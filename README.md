### Built With 

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) and [Posit workbench](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/workbench/).

<!--
> **\[?\]** Please provide the technologies that are used in the
> project.
-->

## Getting Started 

Make sure you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [Posit Workbench](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/workbench/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The contents of the text assumes you're comfortable with R, Posit Workbench, Shiny, and the `tidyverse`. Maybe you haven't built a ton of applications, but you understand reactivity, and you're comfortable with the core Shiny concepts (i.e., the UI, server, `*_Input()`, `*_Output()`, and `render_*` functions, etc.).


## Usage 

The code examples can be found in the [`moviesApp` repo](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp). The sections from each chapter can be found in the branches. 

```bash
git checkout <branch>
```
