This problem often resulted in delays when moving their applications into a production environment.\n\nDid you read Mastering Shiny and want to learn more about package development?\n\nMastering Shiny is an excellent introduction to the captivating world of Shiny and provides a foundation of best practices for building applications. R packages are covered in Mastering Shiny, and this chapter is a great place to start. 1 However, to fully understand and appreciate the benefits of developing Shiny apps in R packages, I wanted a resource that includes a full tour of the package development tools (loading, testing, deploying, etc.).\n\nDid you read Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps and decide the golem framework wasn’t a good fit for your application?\n\ngolem is the ‘opinionated framework for building production-grade Shiny applications’ introduced in Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps (or EPGSA). golem offers a robust and standardized way to build, maintain, and deploy production-grade Shiny apps. Whether due to the learning curve, overhead, dependencies, legacy code, or your particular deployment constraints, golem might not be the right fit for your situation.2"

    "text": "Connecting the dots\n‘Production’ usually means passing the code from your personal development environment into your company’s cloud-based server environment, which typically involves bundling your app in a structure that can be shared, installed, tested, and launched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to put something into production?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘I think the easiest way to think about it for me is that we develop a model in one computational environment–think of this as maybe your laptop or maybe you work in a server environment–still, it’s in one place, and it turns out the software that you need to have installed there is about tuning, training, etc. Putting something into production is getting it out of that computational environment and successfully carrying it over to a new computational environment. For many people, this might be like a cloud computing environment. It might be some kind of server your organization has, and we need to take it, lift it, and then successfully have it working.’ - Julia Silge, What is ‘production’ anyway? MLOps for the curious (SatRdays London 2023)\n\nI’ve added emphasis and edited this for clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nR packages are designed for other users to install and load into their R environment. The package structure offers a standardized way of extending R’s capabilities by adding new functionality (like developing Shiny apps!).\nThis book is a resource to help ‘connect the dots’ between building scalable Shiny applications and writing R packages. Adopting R package development practices in the early stages of your Shiny app will improve the reusability, maintainability, and shareability of all your hard work."

Developing Shiny apps involves harnessing the connection between inputs, reactivity, and outputs to control and predict the application’s behavior.\nShiny programming differs from regular R programming in several key aspects:\n\n\nAn Event-driven UI: Shiny apps require developers to design and develop a user interface (UI). User experience (UX) design is an entirely separate field, but as Shiny developers, we need to know enough to allow users to interact with and navigate our apps. The UI also captures each ‘event,’ meaning that the user’s actions (such as button clicks or input changes) trigger the application’s inputs, updates, or outputs.\n\nRegular R programming often involves executing predefined steps or functions without direct interaction or responses to user events.\n\n\n\nA Reactive Server: In Shiny, the application’s behavior is determined by the dependencies between reactive inputs (i.e., the inputIds), reactive values, and outputs (i.e., the outputIds), allowing for automatic updates and propagation of changes throughout the application.\n\nIn standard R programming, we typically define a series of sequential steps (i.e., functions) that operate on data to generate output to the console or a typesetting system for technical and scientific publications (model results, graphs, tables, etc.) without accounting for reactivity or downstream changes.\n\n\n\nLearning reactivity can be challenging when you start, but fortunately, there are excellent tutorials and articles to help you along the way!"

    "text": "Projects, packages, and app-packages\nBefore we start, we should establish some ‘operational definitions’ of what I mean by the terms ‘project’, ‘package’, and ‘app-package’.\n\n\nI’ll use color to differentiate shiny app projects, R packages, and app-packages.\n\nProject: I consider a project to be any directory of files requiring R (the binary downloaded from CRAN with a version number and neat names like, ‘R 4.3.1 “Beagle Scouts” released on …’) to execute with an RStudio/Posit workbench project file (.Rproj).\nPackage: I’ll use the term package to describe a directory of functions, documentation, or data that can be installed and loaded into an R session. A package includes the necessary dependency management (NAMESPACE) and metadata files (DESCRIPTION) and has access to the package development tools in RStudio/Posit Workbench.\nApp-package: An app-package (which you have probably already guessed) is a package containing a shiny application. App-packages have all of the functionality of a standard R package but also contain the files and folders required to successfully develop, run, and deploy a shiny app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Packages & Posit Workbench\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit Workbench (formerly RStudio) is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) that streamlines many R package development tasks. I’ve purposely connected Posit Workbench to the definitions above for package and app-package–specifically, the package development tools provided in the Build pane and devtools.\nHowever, developing R packages in Posit Workbench (or using .Rproj files) is not required. There are alternative package development tools and processes outside of Posit Workbench, and many developers employ these setups.\nPackage development outside Posit Workbench would look almost identical to development in the IDE:\n\nCreate the package structure (R/ folder for .R scripts, man/ folder for documentation, data/ folder for datasets, etc.)\nAdd DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files, etc.\nEnsure the package can be installed and loaded into an R session.\n\nIt’s also possible to use many of the development workflow functions we’ll cover here outside of the IDE (roxygen2::roxygenize(), devtools::check(), devtools::install(), etc.).\n\n\n\n\nThe previous chapter covered a few practices to adopt during shiny development that improve the extensibility of your app project to an app-package (these are summarized in the callout box below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny ‘pre-package’ practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFolders\n\nwww: can be used to store static resources (images, CSS files, JavaScript)\n\nR/: any .R files in the R/ folder will automatically be loaded with your app when it’s run.\n\nConverting the code in app.R into separate functions (i.e., modules and standalone app functions) also allows you to develop and debug the code independently.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles\n\n\nDESCRIPTION files store metadata and include fields for application deployment (i.e., DisplayMode: Showcase)\n\n\nREADME.md files can document application descriptions, purposes, requirements, etc.\n\n\n\nDependencies\n\n\nrenv can be used to help manage app dependencies.\n\nRun renv::status() & renv::snapshot() to record dependencies in the lock file."

We ran devtools::load_all() above without the presence of the Build pane because the IDE displays the Build pane after reading the fields in the projApp.Rproj file.\nThe quickest way to access the fields in the .Rproj file is under Tools &gt; Project options.\nDefault project options\nTools &gt; Project options provide access to the project-level options. For example, fields 2 - 4 are available under General, 5 - 8 affect the Code options, and the final two fields deal with Sweave.\n\n\n\n(a) projApp.Rproj fields\n\nFigure 4: Field settings from projApp.Rproj file\n\nThe default settings were created when we selected the Shiny App project project from the New Project Wizard in the last chapter.\nBuild tools\nIf you’ve read the What makes an RStudio Project? section of R Packages (2 ed), you’ll notice a few differences between each .Rproj file (I’ve placed the files side-by-side so you can compare them below):\n\n\n\n(a) .Rproj files\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of projApp.Rproj file and .Rproj file in R Packages, 2ed\n\nI’ve circled the fields in the R Packages, 2ed .Rproj file that illustrate it’s configured to work with a package.

By default, R tries to compile packages for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures if running in a 64-bit R session on Windows. This flag can help avoid problems if a package can only be compiled on one architecture. Read more here.\n--with-keep.source: In R, when a function is created, its body can be stored in two ways: 1) as a parsed but unevaluated expression and 2) as a character string containing the function’s source code. By default, only the parsed expression is kept. If –with-keep.source is specified, R will also keep the source code as a character string, which can be helpful for debugging and tools that analyze or modify source code.

    "text": "Creating packages with create_package()\n\nThe Posit documentation lists the following ways to create R packages,\n\n\nCall usethis::create_package().\nIn RStudio, do File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; R Package. This ultimately calls usethis::create_package(), so really there’s just one way.\n\n\nWhile this information isn’t incorrect, we just demonstrated it’s possible to create a package without the usethis::create_package() function. Still, if you’re looking for a way to quickly create or convert your app project into an app-package, using create_package() is a great option.\nThis function is covered in the ‘Fundamental development workflows’ chapter of R Packages, 2ed. I’ve provided some suggestions below for using create_package().\nNew app-packages\nIf you want to create a new shiny app-package, but haven’t written any code, you can create it with the create_package() function from the usethis package.\nFirst, install devtools:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\nlibrary(devtools)\n\ndevtools automatically loads usethis\nLoading required package: usethis\nAssuming your current working directory is where you want your new app-package, call usethis::create_package() with the path argument set to getwd()\n\nusethis::create_package(path = getwd())\n\nThis call launches a series of actions:\n\n\nFirst, the active project is set to whatever was given to the path argument.\n✔ Setting active project to 'path/to/newApp'\n\n\nThe R/ folder and DESCRIPTION/ file are created:\n✔ Creating 'R/'\n✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'\n\n\nThe NAMESPACE and .Rproj files are created:\n✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'\n✔ Writing 'newApp.Rproj'\n\n\nThe .Rproj is added to the .Rbuildignore file, the .Rproj.user folder is added to the .gitignore and .Rbuildignore files.\n✔ Adding '^newApp\\\\.Rproj$' to '.Rbuildignore'\n✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'\n✔ Adding '^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'\n\n\nA new session is opened from the new .Rproj file:\n✔ Opening 'path/to/newApp/' in new RStudio session\n\n\nWhen the new session opens, newApp has the following contents:\n\nnewApp/\n  ├── .Rbuildignore\n  ├── .Rproj.user/\n  ├── .gitignore\n  ├── DESCRIPTION\n  ├── NAMESPACE\n  ├── R/\n  └── projApp.Rproj\n\nYou’re now free to develop newApp. Store and document any .R files in the R/ folder, edit the DESCRIPTION file with details about the application, read through R Packages and Mastering Shiny, and add the shiny code to complete your app-package\nConverting existing app\nIf you already have a shiny app project that needs to be converted into an app-package (like the app files stored in the 03_projApp branch), you can also use create_package(path = getwd()) in your root folder, but I recommend using the following arguments:\n\nDESCRIPTION arguments\n\n\nfields: these are arguments passed to usethis::use_description(). If the fields argument is empty, a boilerplate DESCRIPTION file is created (similar to this one).\n\nThese boilerplate fields in the DESCRIPTION work, but I’ve found some of the fields are unnecessary (i.e., I’ve never needed Authors@R: or ORCID) and inevitably require revision, so I’d prefer to handle this during the creation process (and remove the risk of forgetting to change it later).\nAll fields should be passed in a list() as field = 'value' pairs.\n\n\nusethis::use_description(\n    list(Package = 'projApp',\n         Version = '0.0.0.9000',\n         Title = 'movies app',\n         Description = 'A movie-review shiny application.',\n         \"Authors@R\" = NULL,\n         Author = utils::person(\n            given = \"John\", \n            family = \"Smith\", \n            role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\")),\n          Maintainer = utils::person(\n            given = \"John\", \n            family = \"Smith\",\n            email = \"John.Smith@email.io\"),\n          License = \"GPL-3\"))\n\n\n\nA few fields require specially formatted values (see the utils::person() examples below).\n\nutils::person(\"John\", \"Smith\", \n              email = \"John.Smith@email.io\", \n              role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))\n\n[1] \"John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt; [aut, cre]\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo additional arguments from use_description() are passed to create_package():\n\ncheck_name: verifies your app-package name is valid for CRAN, so we can set this to FALSE (unless you’re planning on submitting to CRAN)\nroxygen2: is TRUE by default and adds the fields required to use roxygen2 (which I won’t cover here because we’ll cover documentation in-depth in a future chapter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: Don’t use usethis::create_package('.')!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen converting your existing shiny app project into an app-package with usethis::create_package(), don’t use '.' in the path argument:\nusethis::create_package('.')\nThis will return the following warning about creating nested projects, and ask if you want to proceed anyway:\nNew project 'projApp' is nested inside an existing project\n'./', which is rarely a good idea.

Upgrading automatically...\nSetting `RoxygenNote` to \"7.2.3\"\ndevtools relies on roxygen2 for package documentation, so the RoxygenNote field is required in the DESCRIPTION. You may have noticed calling document() also calls load_all(), which scans the loaded package contents for special documentation syntax before writing the NAMESPACE file (we’ll cover the NAMESPACE in the chapter on Dependencies).\nℹ Loading projApp\nWriting NAMESPACE\nIf we open the NAMESPACE file, we see it’s empty (and that we shouldn’t edit this file by hand).\n\n\n\n(a) NAMESPACE\n\nFigure 1: Initial NAMESPACE file\n\nThe last few output lines warn us to include the Encoding field in the DESCRIPTION. devtools won’t automatically add Encoding (like it did with RoxygenNote above), so we’ll need to add it to the DESCRIPTION file manually:\nWarning message:\nroxygen2 requires Encoding: \"UTF-8\"\nℹ Current encoding is NA \nNote: The Encoding value shouldn’t include quotes like the warning message above (i.e., UTF-8). See the example below:\n\nPackage: projApp\nVersion: 0.0.0.9000\nType: Package\nTitle: movies app\nDescription: A movies data shiny application.\nAuthor: John Smith [aut, cre]\nMaintainer: John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt;\nLicense: GPL-3\nRoxygenNote: 7.2.3\nEncoding: UTF-8\n\n\n\n\nAlways leave empty final line in the DESCRIPTION file.\n\nAfter adding the required fields to the DESCRIPTION file, we’ll document() the package again using the keyboard shortcut:\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\n\nIn the Build pane, we see the following:\n==&gt; devtools::document(roclets = c('rd', 'collate', 'namespace'))\n\nℹ Updating projApp documentation\nℹ Loading projApp\nDocumentation completed\nDocument the package whenever changes are made to any roxygen2 syntax (or settings).\nInstall\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + B\n\nThe final package development habit to adopt is regularly installing the package with devtools::install().\n\ndevtools::install()\n\ninstall() will prompt the following output in the Build pane:\n==&gt; R CMD INSTALL --preclean --no-multiarch --with-keep.source projApp\n\n* installing to library ‘/path/to/local/install/projApp-090c61fc/R-4.2/x86_64-apple-darwin17.0’\n* installing *source* package ‘projApp’ ...\n** using staged installation\n** R\n** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading\nNo man pages found in package  ‘projApp’ \n** help\n*** installing help indices\n** building package indices\n** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location\n** testing if installed package can be loaded from final location\n** testing if installed package keeps a record of temporary installation path\n* DONE (projApp)\nThere are a few connections worth making in this initial install() output:\n\n\nThe first line in the output should look familiar–we saw both of these settings in the projApp.Rproj file from the previous chapter\nPackageInstallArgs: --no-multiarch --with-keep.source\n\nNo man pages found in package 'projApp' tells us none of the code in R/ has adequately been documented (which we’ll cover in the roxygen2 chapter)\ninstall() attempts to install the package from the *source* files and a ‘bundle’ or source tarball file (i.e., .tar.gz)\nhelp files are built, along with other documentation (like vignettes)\nDONE (projApp) means projApp was successfully installed!\n\nInstall a package after the initial setup, after major changes to the code, documentation, or dependencies, and before committing or sharing.\n\n\n\n\nGit Branch\n\nThis section’s code is in the projApp repo’s 06_devtools branch\nCheck?\ndevtools::check() performs a series of checks to ensure a package meets the standards set by CRAN. You can consider check() as a ‘quality control’ function for documentation, NAMESPACE dependencies, unnecessary or non-standard folders and files, etc. R Packages recommends using check() often, but I agree with the advice in Mastering Shiny on using check() with app-packages,\n\n‘I don’t recommend that you [call devtools::check()] the first time, the second time, or even the third time you try out the package structure.

This chapter also covered 1) how to create a new shiny app-package or 2) convert an existing shiny project into an app-package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: GitHub branches\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code for Chapter 2 (Projects) is stored in the following branches:\n\n03_projApp is an ‘advanced’ package from the previous chapter\n04_description is a branch from 03_projApp and adds the seven mandatory DESCRIPTION fields.\n05_rproj is a branch from 04_description and manually converts the shiny app project to a shiny app-package using the .Rproj file.\n06_create-package is a branch from 03_projApp and creates a package using usethis::create_package()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevtools (Chapter 3)\ndevtools introduced the devtools package and its core functions (load_all(), document(), and install()).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: GitHub branches\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code for Chapter 3 (devtools) is stored in the following branch:\n\n\n06_devtools is a branch from the manually converted app-package in 05_rproj\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re now at a point that we’ve converted a Shiny project (projApp) into a package. The package conversions live in the 06_devtools and 06_create-package branches:\n\n\nIn the 06_devtools branch, projApp was converted to a package by manually adding the required fields to the DESCRIPTION file, then running the key devtools development functions (load_all(), document(), and install())\n\nPackage: projApp\nTitle: movies app\nVersion: 0.0.0.9000\nAuthor: John Smith [aut, cre]\nMaintainer: John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt;\nDescription: A movie-review shiny application.\nLicense: GPL-3\nRoxygenNote: 7.2.3\nEncoding: UTF-8\n\n\n\nIn the 06_create-package branch, we used the usethis::create_package() function to convert projApp into a package.\n\nPackage: projApp\nTitle: movies app\nVersion: 0.0.0.9000\nAuthor: John Smith [aut, cre]\nMaintainer: John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt;\nDescription: A movie-review shiny application.\nLicense: GPL-3\nEncoding: UTF-8\nRoxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\nRoxygenNote: 7.2.3\n\n\n\nThe only difference between these two branches lies in the DESCRIPTION files–in the 06_create-package branch, the Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE) field was added (which we will cover in the upcoming Documentation chapter)."

In pkgApp(), the inputs are collected with the var_input module and then passed to the scatter_display module.\nI use @seealso to connect mod_var_input_ui() to its server function counterpart. The hyperlink to mod_var_input_server() from mod_var_input_ui() is created by placing the destination function in square brackets [fun()]:\n#' Variable input module (UI)\n#' \n#' @description\n#' `var_input` collects the following graph inputs:\n#'  * `input$x`\n#'  * `input$y`\n#'  * `input$z`\n#'  * `input$alpha`\n#'  * `input$size`\n#'  * `input$plot_title`\n#'\n#' @param id UI module id\n#'\n#' @return module UI (HTML)\n#' \n#' @seealso [mod_var_input_server()]\n#' \n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\n\n@seealso creates a hyperlink readers can use to open the next module in the execution path.\n\n\n\n\n(a) @seealso link\n\nFigure 9: Link values from var_input to scatter_display\n\n\nIn mod_var_input_server(), a link can be made to mod_scatter_display_server() (the module function collecting the returned values) using the square brackets in the @return section (without @seealso):\n#' Variable input module (server)\n#'\n#' @param id server module id\n#' \n#' @seealso [mod_var_input_ui()]\n#'\n#' @return reactive inputs are returned in a `list()`: \n#'  * `\"y\" = input$y`\n#'  * `\"x\" = input$x`\n#'  * `\"z\" = input$z`\n#'  * `\"alpha\" = input$alpha`\n#'  * `\"size\" = input$size`\n#'  * `\"plot_title\" = input$plot_title`\n#'  \n#' These become in the `var_inputs()` argument in [mod_scatter_display_server()]\n#' \n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) @seealso in mod_var_input_ui()\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) @seealso in mod_var_input_server()\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Link values from var_input to scatter_display\n\n\n\n@family\nModule functions can also be grouped into families using @family {\"description\"}.

    "section": "Identifying dependencies",
    "text": "Identifying dependencies\nThe first step in managing dependencies is identifying which add-on packages pkgApp relies on. Our goal is to limit the dependencies to only those critical to the functioning of our app, because each additional dependency is a potential point of failure (should this package become unavailable or significantly change).\nI’ve made this process somewhat easier by explicitly namespacing all of the add-on package functions in pkgApp (i.e., with pkg::fun()). You’ll learn more about explicit namespacing in the following sections.\nRunning movies_app()\n\nIn the last chapter, we moved and documented the standalone app function (movies_app()) in the R/ folder. The app.R file now only contains the following:\n\n# pkgs &lt;- c(\"shiny\", \"shinythemes\", \"stringr\", \"ggplot2\", \"rlang\")\n# install.packages(pkgs, quiet = TRUE)\n\n# packages ------------------------------------\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(shinythemes)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(rlang)\n\n# movies_app ------------------------------------\nmovies_app()\n\nIdeally, we’ll want to replace these calls to libary(), but first we have to make sure the functions we’re using in these packages will be available in pkgApp.\nWhen we run the contents of app.R, we see the following:\n&gt; library(pkgApp)\n&gt; # pkgs &lt;- c(\"shiny\", \"shinythemes\", \"stringr\", \"ggplot2\", \"rlang\")\n&gt; # install.packages(pkgs, quiet = TRUE)\n&gt; \n&gt; # packages ------------------------------------\n&gt; library(shiny)\n&gt; library(shinythemes)\n&gt; library(stringr)\n&gt; library(ggplot2)\n&gt; library(rlang)\n&gt; \n&gt; # movies_app ------------------------------------\n&gt; movies_app()\nError in movies_app() : could not find function \"movies_app\"\nWhy can’t R find the \"movies_app\" function in app.R?\nLet’s recap what we’ve done so far:\n\n\napp.R\n\n\napp.R loads the necessary packages and calls movies_app()\n\n\npkgApp/\n    └── app.R\n\n\n\n\n\nR/\n\n\nThe R/movies_app.R file contains the code and documentation for movies_app()\n\n\npkgApp/\n    └── R/\n        └── movies_app.R\n\n\n\n\n\nman/\n\n\nroxygen2 is generating the man/movies_app.Rd file\n\npkgApp/\n    └── man/\n          └── movies_app.Rd\n\n\n\nThe error tells me that despite having documentation for movies_app() in R/ and generating the corresponding .Rd file in man/, the movies_app() function isn’t being exported from pkgApp."

After loading, documenting, and installing pkgApp, the NAMESPACE is updated with export(movies_app), and the Console automatically calls library(pkgApp).\nls() returns “the names of the objects in the specified environment, so we can use it to confirm the movies_app() function is the only export from pkgApp:\n\nls(name = \"package:pkgApp\")\n\n[1] \"movies_app\"\nThe search() list\nlibrary(pkgApp) attaches pkgApp to the search list. We can view all the attached packages in the string returned from search():\n\"package:pkgApp\" %in% search()\n[1] TRUE\nWhat about the functions from add-on packages movies_app() relies on, like ggplot2?\nLet’s check to see if ggplot2 is also attached to the search() list:\n\nc(\"package:ggplot2\") %in% search()\n\n[1] FALSE\nWhy does this matter? Because if these packages aren’t attached to the search() list, we can’t call their functions the way we would if we’d used library().\nFor example, if we try to use ggplot2 to build a plot (similar to the one we have in the app), we see the following:\n\nggplot(data = mtcars, \n  aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nError in ggplot(data = mtcars, \n              aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) : \n  could not find function \"ggplot\"\nIf we want to use functions from the packages pkgApp relies on, we need to explicitly namespace these functions from their original package namespaces (i.e., pkg::fun()):\n\n\n\nggplot2::ggplot(data = mtcars, \n  ggplot2::aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + \n  ggplot2::geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nWe can use ggplot2 if we explicitly namespace it’s functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing add-on package functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a user loads pkgApp with library(pkgApp), any add-on package functions used in exports are available to users if they use pkg::fun() (or if they load the package themselves with library()).\n\n\n\n\nAccess to add-on package functions has implications for the other functions in pkgApp–for example, the scatter_plot() function uses ggplot2 functions. But we’re not exporting scatter_plot(), so when we attempt to run the examples, we see the following error:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Examples in scatter_plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Error in scatter_plot() examples\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Examples in scatter_plot() function without exporting\n\n\n\nExamples for ‘pkgApp::scatter_plot’\nThe message at the top of the Help pane is informative because it tells us that despite scatter_plot() being functional when we run movies_app(), it’s not part of the package namespace (and thus, not accessible to users in the help file).\nExporting scatter_plot()\n\nShiny apps often contain utility functions in helper.R or utils.R files. Storing non-shiny code in these files isn’t a bad practice (in fact, it’s encouraged in Mastering Shiny). However, if we’re following the advice in R Packages, we should rename R/utils.R as we transition to an app-package,\n\n‘most of our packages have a utils.R file (Section 6.1) that contains small utility functions that are useful internally, but aren’t part of the core purpose of those packages. We don’t export such functions.’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR/utils.R &gt;&gt; R/scatter_plot.R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom now on, I’ve renamed R/utils.R to R/scatter_plot.R, so it aligns with the naming conventions in other R packages.\nFor a deep dive on R/utils.R files in R packages, I recommend reading Dissecting R Package “Utility Belts”\n\n\n\n\nLet’s add the @export tag to R/scatter_plot.R so it’s exported from pkgApp.\n\n#' Create scatter plot \n#'\n#' Custom [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) function for building scatter plots in `pkgApp()`.\n#' \n#' \n#' @param df `data.frame` or `tibble`\n#' @param x_var string variable mapped to `x` axis\n#' @param y_var string variable mapped to `y` axis\n#' @param col_var string variable mapped to `color`\n#' @param alpha_var number for point `alpha`\n#' @param size_var number for point `size` \n#' \n#' @return A `ggplot2` plot object\n#' \n#' \n#' @examples\n#' scatter_plot(mtcars, \n#'     x_var = \"mpg\", \n#'     y_var = \"disp\", \n#'     col_var = \"cyl\", \n#'     alpha_var = 0.5, \n#'     size_var = 3)\n#'     \n#' @seealso [mod_scatter_display_server()]\n#' \n#' @export\n#' \n\nAfter loading, documenting, and installing pkgApp, the NAMESPACE is updated with the export() directive:\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L / D / B\n\nThe contents of the updated NAMESPACE file are below (and pkgApp:: in the Console now displays the scatter_plot() help file in the tab completion):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) @export the scatter_plot function\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) pkgApp::scatter_plot()\n\n\n\nFigure 3: scatter_plot() is now part of the pkgApp namespace\n\n\n\nBelow, we confirm users can access the help file for scatter_plot() and run the examples:\n\n\n\n(a) scatter_plot() examples\n\nFigure 4: Running examples in ?scatter_plot\n\nloadedNamespaces()\nWe’ve already confirmed that ggplot2 isn’t attached with pkgApp (and hence, it is not included in the search() list)\n\nc(\"package:ggplot2\") %in% search()\n\n[1]  FALSE\nHowever, we can access the functions we used the pkg::fun() syntax with because those functions are included in the loaded namespaces (which we can view with loadedNamespaces())\n\nc(\"ggplot2\") %in% loadedNamespaces()\n\n[1] TRUE\nWhat to @export\n\n“When a user calls library(pkgApp), what functions do I want to be available?”\nWhen determining which functions to export, consider the question above. R Packages, 2ed also offers the following advice on what shouldn’t be exported:\n\n‘We believe that packages that have a wide audience should strive to do one thing and do it well. All functions in a package should be related to a single problem (or a set of closely related problems). Any functions not related to that purpose should not be exported.’ - What to export, R Packages, 2ed\n\nThere are multiple ways to interpret the advice above in the context of a shiny app-package:\n\nIf we take a narrow view of the word ‘problem’ to mean ‘create a way to visualize relationships in movie review data’, then maybe we’d consider it solved by only exporting the standalone app function.\nIf the ‘problem’ pkgApp solves is ‘creating a shiny movies app’, we might also want to export any functions that perform distinct tasks with potentially reusable functionality (i.e., generate specific UI components, perform data processing tasks, etc.).\nExtending the ‘problem’ statement to the broadest possible definition would assume users will want access to all the functions in pkgApp–this would allow them to customize, extend, or integrate the contents of pkgApp with other tools. You’ll rarely want to export everything from your app-package, but it can be helpful if your primary audience is other developers within your organization.\n\nMy advice on exports is to balance simplicity and utility when deciding on exported functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-key @exports with @keywords internal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like function to be exported, but not listed in the package index, you can combine @export with @keywords internal. These should be used in combination,\n#' @export\n#' \n#' @keywords internal\nFor example, adding @export and @keywords internal to R/scatter_plot.R will make the function accessible to users:\n\n\n\n\nAnd include the help file:\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if a user were to click on the Index for pkgApp (at the bottom of the help file)\n\n\n\n\nscatter_plot is not listed:"

These packages are installed whenever a user installs pkgApp.\nOn the other hand, the NAMESPACE directives manage function-level access, importing functions from other packages to be used in pkgApp and–as we’ve seen above–exporting functions from pkgApp for others to use.\nWhen pkgApp is documented (i.e., Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D), roxygen2 tags update the NAMESPACE with any imports or exports. However, the DESCRIPTION file must be edited independently:\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D updates the NAMESPACE, but it doesn’t change anything in the DESCRIPTION file.\n\n\n\n\n(a) roxygen2 does not connect the NAMESPACE to the DESCRIPTION\n\nFigure 5: roxygen2 & NAMESPACE = function-level access vs. DESCRIPTION = package-level dependencies\n\nThe differences between the dependencies listed in the NAMESPACE directives and the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION file can be a common point of confusion 1, which is understandable if you’ve consulted Writing R Extensions (specifically the sections on dependencies 2 and namespaces.3\nI’ve attempted to distill and consolidate the advice I’ve found when I’ve gone looking for (and had trouble finding) answers to the following questions:\n\nHow and where should I be importing add-on functions and packages?\nWhy and when should I import add-on packages/functions? and\nWhat happens when a package or function is imported?\n\nI’ve also emphasized the parts I’ve found worth committing to memory.\nHow and where?\nThere are three ways to import dependencies:\n\nUse a ‘fully qualified variable reference’ (i.e., the pkg::fun() syntax)4 for calls to add-on functions in the R/ folder\n\n\nList add-on packages in the Imports field of the DESCRIPTION file\nInclude an @import or @importFrom tag for add-on packages in the R/ folder roxygen25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow and where to use…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg::fun()\nImports (DESCRIPTION)\n@import/@importFrom (NAMESPACE)\n\n\n\nWriting R Extensions refers to the pkg::fun() syntax as a ‘fully-qualified reference’:\n\n“A fully-qualified reference to the function f in package foo is of the form foo::f.” - Specifying imports and exports\n\nUsing ‘pkg::fun()’ can seem tedious at first, but fortunately we have tools like tab-completion (if you’re using the Posit Workbench IDE) and packages like sinew (which we’ll cover in a later chapter)\n\n\nR Packages, 2ed recommends using the usethis::use_package() function to include add-on packages to the Imports field of the DESCRIRPTION file6\n\n“Remember usethis::use_package() is helpful for adding dependencies to DESCRIPTION” - Dependencies: In Practice\n\n\n\nR Packages, 2ed assumes you’ll be building your app-package with roxygen2 and devtools::document(), so the authors recommend using the usethis::use_import_from()7\n\n“A handy function for your interactive workflow is usethis::use_import_from()” - In code below R/\n\nUsing usethis::use_import_from() also adds a new R/[app-package]-package.R file, which can server as a ‘central repository’ for the imported functions and packages (see usethis::use_package_doc() also).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow and where in pkgApp\n\nWe’re already using pkg::fun() in the two exported functions from pkgApp (movies_app() and scatter_plot()):\n\n\npkg::fun() in movies_app():\n\n\nshow/hide explicit namespacing in movies_app()movies_app &lt;- function() {\n  shiny::shinyApp(ui = movies_ui, server = movies_server)\n}\n\n\n\n\npkg::fun() in scatter_plot():\n\n\nshow/hide explicit namespacing in scatter_plot()scatter_plot &lt;- function(df, x_var, y_var, col_var, alpha_var, size_var) {\n    ggplot2::ggplot(data = df,\n      ggplot2::aes(x = .data[[x_var]],\n          y = .data[[y_var]],\n          color = .data[[col_var]])) +\n      ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = alpha_var, size = size_var)\n\n}\n\n\nNow let’s cover when and why to list these packages and functions as imports.\nWhen and why?\nKnowing when and why to use each import method is just as important as knowing how and where to import add-on packages and functions.\nI’ve done my best to distill the available information into actionable decisions below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen and why to use…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg::fun()\nImports (DESCRIPTION)\n@import/@importFrom (NAMESPACE)\n\n\n\nIf your app-package only uses a handful of functions from an add-on package, using pkg::fun() is fine8\n\n“If a package only needs a few objects from another package it can use a fully qualified variable reference (foo::f) in the code instead of a formal import.” - Specifying imports and exports\n\nIf there is a potential name conflict, use the pkg::fun() syntax:\n\nUsing the foo::f form will be necessary when a package needs to use a function of the same name from more than one namespace.” - Specifying imports and exports\n\nOn the other hand, R Packages, 2ed recommends defaulting to pkg::fun() for calls to any add-on packages in the R/ folder because it makes these calls more explicit:\n\n“…the package::function() calling style is also our default recommendation for how to use your dependencies in the code below R/, because it eliminates all ambiguity.” - R packages, Namespace\n“Our recommended default is to call external functions using the package::function() syntax” - R Packages 2ed, In code below R/\n\n\n\nWriting R Extensions states that any add-on package functions using pkg::fun() should be listed in the DESCRIPTION (specifically, the Imports field).\n\n“The Imports field lists packages whose namespaces are imported from (as specified in the NAMESPACE file) but which do not need to be attached. Namespaces accessed by the :: and ::: operators must be listed here.” - Package Dependencies\n\nYou might be wondering, “What if I list a package in DESCRIPTION/Imports field, but don’t list it in the NAMESPACE?” R Packages, 2ed addresses this:\n\n“It is common for a package to be listed in Imports in DESCRIPTION, but not in NAMESPACE. The converse is not true. Every package mentioned in NAMESPACE must also be present in the Imports or Depends fields.” - Confusion about Imports\n\nOn when to use Imports vs. Depends:\n\nUnless there is a good reason otherwise, you should always list packages in Imports not Depends.” - Whether to Import or Depend\n\n\n\nWriting R Extensions states ‘variables exported from other packages’ need to be listed in the NAMESPACE (and recommends using @importFrom over @import in most cases):\n\n“Variables exported from other packages with namespaces need to be imported explicitly using the directives Imports and importFrom” Specifying imports and exports\n“Using importFrom selectively rather than Imports is good practice and recommended notably when importing from packages with more than a dozen exports and especially from those written by others (so what they export can change in future).” - Specifying imports and exports.\n\nUsing pkg::fun() is also referred to as less efficient than a ‘formal import’ in Writing R Extensions (a ‘formal import’ means the add-on package function uses a directive in the NAMESPACE):\n\n“[foo::f] is slightly less efficient than a formal import and also loses the advantage of recording all dependencies in the NAMESPACE file” - Specifying imports and exports.\n\nHowever, R Packages, 2ed recommends minimizing the use of both @import and @importFrom (the aaapkg represents a hypothetical package listed in the Imports field of the DESCRIPTION file in the example below)\n\n“Specifically, we recommend that you default to not importing anything from aaapkg into your namespace. This makes it very easy to identify which functions live outside of your package, which is especially useful when you read your code in the future. This also eliminates any concerns about name conflicts between aaapkg and your package.” Package is listed in Imports\n\nBut R Packages, 2ed also notes the following exceptions to this rule in Package is listed in Imports:\n\n“Sometimes you make such heavy use of so many functions from another package that you want to import its entire namespace.” 9\n“You can’t call an operator from another package via ::, so you must import it.” 10\n\nIf you happen to read the advice from the footnote, you’ll also find somewhat conflicting advice:\n\n“Always use a NAMESPACE to specify imports so that your package code isn’t harmed by other peoples’ use of Depends.” - Whether to Import or Depend: footnote reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen and why in pkgApp\n\nI’ve found the best guidance on when and why to use each method (pkg::fun(), Imports in the DESCRIPTION, or @import/@importFrom) comes from the roxygen2 documentation:\n\n“if you are using just a few functions from another package, we recommending adding the package to the Imports: field of the DESCRIPTION file and calling the functions explicitly using ::, e.g., pkg::fun()”\n“If the repetition of the package name becomes annoying you can @importFrom and drop the [pkg::fun()]” - Importing functions\n\nFollowing this advice (and the exceptions to the rule regarding ‘heavy use’11 and ‘operators’12 from add-on packages) we can:\n\n\nReplace the explicit namespacing from all calls to shiny functions (i.e., shiny::) with the @import tag in R/movies_app.R:\n\n\nshow/hide @import in movies_app()#' Movies app standalone function\n#'\n#' Wrapper function for `shinyApp()`\n#'\n#' @return shiny app\n#' \n#' \n#' @seealso [mod_var_input_ui()], [mod_var_input_server()], [mod_scatter_display_ui()], [mod_scatter_display_server()]\n#' \n#' @import shiny\n#'\n#' @export\n#' \nmovies_app &lt;- function() {\n  shinyApp(ui = movies_ui, server = movies_server)\n}\n\n\n\n\nInclude @importFrom for the use of .data in R/scatter_plot.R:\n\n\nshow/hide @importFrom in scatter_plot()#' Create scatter plot \n#'\n#' Custom [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) function for building scatter plots in `pkgApp()`.\n#' \n#' \n#' @param df `data.frame` or `tibble`\n#' @param x_var string variable mapped to `x` axis\n#' @param y_var string variable mapped to `y` axis\n#' @param col_var string variable mapped to `color`\n#' @param alpha_var number for point `alpha`\n#' @param size_var number for point `size` \n#' \n#' @return A `ggplot2` plot object\n#' \n#' \n#' @examples\n#' scatter_plot(mtcars, \n#'     x_var = \"mpg\", \n#'     y_var = \"disp\", \n#'     col_var = \"cyl\", \n#'     alpha_var = 0.5, \n#'     size_var = 3)\n#'     \n#' @seealso [mod_scatter_display_server()]\n#' \n#' @importFrom rlang .data\n#' \n#' @export\n#' \nscatter_plot &lt;- function(df, x_var, y_var, col_var, alpha_var, size_var) {\n    ggplot2::ggplot(data = df,\n      ggplot2::aes(x = .data[[x_var]],\n          y = .data[[y_var]],\n          color = .data[[col_var]])) +\n      ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = alpha_var, size = size_var)\n\n}\n\n\nFinally, we need to list each add-on package to the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION using usethis::use_package() (below is the output for ggplot2):\nusethis::use_package(\"ggplot2\")\n✔ Setting active project to '/path/to/pkgApp'\n✔ Adding 'ggplot2' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION\n• Refer to functions with `ggplot2::fun()`\nAfter adding all add-on packages to the DESCRIPTION with usethis::use_package(), we’ll load, document, and install pkgApp:\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L / D / B\n\nAnd we should review the updated NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION files:\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Updated NAMESPACE with Imports and `importFrom\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Updated DESCRIPTION with all Imports\n\n\n\nFigure 6: roxygen2 will update the NAMESPACE, but usethis::use_package() is needed to update the DESCRIPTION\n\n\nWhen we run movies_app(), we see the application launches and we can still run the scatter_plot() examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) movies_app() works\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Examples in ?scatter_plot\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Confirming we still have full functionality in pkgApp\n\n\nIn the next section, we’re going to cover what happens when these packages and functions were included as imports in pkgApp.\nWhat happens?\nWhat happens to imported packages and functions can get a bit technical, but I’ve done my best to include what I consider to be the necessary distinctions between using pkg::fun(), the @import/@importFrom tags, and the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION.\nI strongly encourage reading the namespaces section of Advanced R, 2ed for a deeper understanding of these topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when we use…\n\n\n\n\n\npkg::fun()\nImports (DESCRIPTION)\n@import/@importFrom (NAMESPACE)\n\n\n\n\n“Evaluating foo::f will cause package foo to be loaded, but not attached, if it was not loaded already” - Specifying imports and exports.\n\nThis means if users of our package want to use foo::f, they will have to use foo::f.\n\n\nR Packages, 2ed describes what happens to packages listed in Imports:\n\nConsider a dependency that is listed in DESCRIPTION in Imports:\nImports:\n    aaapkg\nThe code inside your package can assume that aaapkg is installed whenever pkg is installed.\n\nR Packages, 2ed also recommends using Imports (instead of Depends) and describes the the differences in their actions (i.e., loading vs. loaded & attaching)\n\n“The main difference is that a package you list in Imports will just be loaded when you use it, whereas a package you list in Depends will be attached when your package is attached. - Whether to Import or Depend\n\n\n\nImports are covered in Advanced R, 2ed:\n\n“Each namespace has an imports environment that can contain bindings to functions used by the package that are defined in another package. The imports environment is controlled by the package developer with the NAMESPACE file. Specifically, directives such as importFrom() and imports() populate this environment.” - Function lookup inside a package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened in pkgApp\n\nFirst, let’s confirm we’re still only exporting movies_app() and scatter_plot() from pkgApp:\n\nls(name = \"package:pkgApp\")\n\n[1] \"movies_app\"   \"scatter_plot\"\nGreat.

    "text": "Updated movies_app()\n\nOne of the key features of shinyApp() is the creation of the shiny.appobj (a shiny app object):\n\napp &lt;- shinyApp(ui = movies_ui, \n                server = movies_server)\nstr(app)\n\nIf we look at the structure of the returned object from shinyApp(), we see the shiny.appobj includes the appDir (the first argument of runApp()).\nList of 5\n $ httpHandler     :function (req)  \n $ serverFuncSource:function ()  \n $ onStart         : NULL\n $ options         : list()\n $ appOptions      :List of 2\n  ..$ appDir       : chr \"/path/to/app/project/pkgApp\"\n  ..$ bookmarkStore: NULL\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"shiny.appobj\"\nWe’ll rewrite movies_app() below using shiny::runApp().\nshiny.launch.browser\nWe want to have control over where the shiny application will be launched from (i.e., the Viewer pane, the IDE Window, or an external browser). We can access this with the shiny.launch.browser option:\n\noptions(shiny.launch.browser = ...)\n\nThe three options above are covered in here, and we want to combine them into a run argument in movies_app()\n\n  switch(EXPR = run, \n    view = options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyPaneViewer),\n    browser = options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyWindowExternal),\n    win = options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyWindowViewer)\n  )\n\ntest.mode\nAnother great feature of runApp() is the ability to control the application’s behavior with test.mode:\n\n‘Should the application be launched in test mode? This is only used for recording or running automated tests. Defaults to the shiny.testmode option, or FALSE if the option is not set.’\n\nThe test.mode argument lets us export values from our application when we’re running tests (which we’ll cover in-depth in the testing chapter).\nWe’ll make test an logical argument (defaulting to TRUE) in our updated movies_app() function.\n\nmovies_app &lt;- function(test = TRUE, run = \"view\") {\n  app &lt;- shinyApp(\n                  ui = movies_ui, \n                  server = movies_server)\n  switch(EXPR = run, \n    view = options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyPaneViewer),\n    browser = options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyWindowExternal),\n    win = options(shiny.launch.browser = .rs.invokeShinyWindowViewer)\n  )\n   if (test)\n      runApp(appDir = app, test.mode = TRUE)\n   else\n      runApp(appDir = app, test.mode = FALSE)\n}\n\n\n\n\nRemember–we don’t need to explicitly namespace shinyApp() or runApp() (i.e., with pkg::fun()) because we’re using #' @import shiny in the R/movies_app.R file.\n\nThe updated roxygen2 documentation for movies_app() is below:\n#' Movies app standalone function\n#'\n#' Wrapper function for `runApp()`\n#' \n#' @param test logical, run in `test.mode`?\n#' @param run where to launch app: \n#'  * `view` = launch in viewer  \n#'  * `browse` = launch in external browser  \n#'  * `win` = launch in window\n#'\n#' @return shiny app\n#' \n#' \n#' @seealso [mod_var_input_ui()], [mod_var_input_server()], [mod_scatter_display_ui()], [mod_scatter_display_server()]\n#' \n#' @import shiny\n#'\n#' @export\n#'"

    "text": "Recap\nThis chapter has covered some options for what to include in the app.R file of your app-package. The differences between shinyApp() and runApp() are worth exploring further, especially if you plan on having more than one apps in a package (or multiple versions of the same application in the same app-package).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap: shinyApp() vs. runApp()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshinyApp():\n\nshinyApp() doesn’t care about file structure, so it’s useful for quick prototyping or if the app is in a single .R script. It’s also more portable because you can share your app with a single .R script.\nIt’s possible to bundle shinyApp() in a wrapper function to integrate within an R package (like we’ve done with movies_app()).\nshinyApp() can also be used to return a shiny app object, which can be useful if you want to explore the app structure programmatically (i.e., testing).\n\nrunApp()\n\nrunApp() is designed for running apps contained in a directory (i.e., runApp('path/to/app'). If the app is in separate ui.R and server.R files (or a single app.R file) runApp() will automatically look for these. However, a shiny app object can also be passed to the appDir argument to launch your app.\nIf you’ve separated your app into multiple files that includes additional assets like data or a www/ folder, runApp() is a better option.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following chapter, we’re going to cover how to ensure movies.Data becomes part of the pkgApp namespace."

CRAN also has a size limit for packages (if you plan on submitting your app-package).\nFormat: data files in data/ must be either .rda or .RData format.\n\nDocumentation: document the data/ files in either a single R/data.R file or individual .R files. Documentation should include the following roxygen2 format:\n#' \n#' @title \n#' \n#' @description\n#' \n#' @format \n#' \\describe{\n#'  \\item{variable}{description}\n#' }\n#'\n'data'\n\ninst/extdata/: Store external data in the inst/extdata/ directory and access it using system.file().

    "text": "This is pkgApp…installed\n\nWe’ve been running load_all(), document(), and install() on pkgApp, but we haven’t looked at the contents of the installed package. Reviewing the installed package will help us understand what the system.file() function is doing, and how we can use the inst/ folder to include external resources to our app-package.\nWhen we run devtools::install(), the output tells us where the package is being installed:\n==&gt; R CMD INSTALL --preclean --no-multiarch --with-keep.source pkgApp\n\n* installing to library ‘/path/to/install/Library/R/x86_64/4.2/library’\nIf we add the pkgApp/ directory to the end of the path above, we can view the contents of the installed package (I’m using the tree command in the Terminal, but the fs::dir_tree() function will also print a folder tree):\n\n/path/to/install/Library/R/x86_64/4.2/library/pkgApp/\n  ├── DESCRIPTION\n  ├── INDEX\n  ├── Meta/\n  │   ├── Rd.rds\n  │   ├── data.rds\n  │   ├── features.rds\n  │   ├── hsearch.rds\n  │   ├── links.rds\n  │   ├── nsInfo.rds\n  │   └── package.rds\n  ├── NAMESPACE\n  ├── R/\n  │   ├── pkgApp\n  │   ├── pkgApp.rdb\n  │   └── pkgApp.rdx\n  ├── data/\n  │   ├── Rdata.rdb\n  │   ├── Rdata.rds\n  │   └── Rdata.rdx\n  ├── extdata/\n  │   └── movies.fst\n  ├── help/\n  │   ├── AnIndex\n  │   ├── aliases.rds\n  │   ├── paths.rds\n  │   ├── pkgApp.rdb\n  │   └── pkgApp.rdx\n  └── html/\n      ├── 00Index.html\n      └── R.css\n\n7 directories, 24 files\n\nThe installed version of pkgApp has many of the same files as the ‘source’ version we’ve been working on (i.e., the NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION). It also might surprise you to see that many of the source package files aren’t included in the installed version (.R, .Rd files. etc.). The key takeaway here is that the inst/ subfolders and files are available in the installed version unchanged (with the inst/ folder omitted.).\nHopefully viewing this folder structure helps demystify what happens when a package is installed. Below is the official documentation on what happens to the inst/ folder (and it’s subfolders) when a package is installed:\n\n“The contents of the inst/ subdirectory will be copied recursively to the installation directory. Subdirectories of inst/ should not interfere with those used by R (currently, R/, data/, demo/, exec/, libs/, man/, help/, html/ and Meta/, and earlier versions used latex/, R-ex/).” - Writing R extensions, Package subdirectories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther installed package structures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can explore the structure of other installed packages to see how they work ‘under the hood’ to gain insight into how they use the inst/ folder.\n\n\nFor example, the inst/extdata/ folder in the readr package holds a variety of datasets:\n/path/to/install/Library/R/x86_64/4.2/library/readr/\n\nextdata/\n  ├── challenge.csv\n  ├── chickens.csv\n  ├── epa78.txt\n  ├── example.log\n  ├── fwf-sample.txt\n  ├── massey-rating.txt\n  ├── mini-gapminder-africa.csv\n  ├── mini-gapminder-americas.csv\n  ├── mini-gapminder-asia.csv\n  ├── mini-gapminder-europe.csv\n  ├── mini-gapminder-oceania.csv\n  ├── mtcars.csv\n  ├── mtcars.csv.bz2\n  ├── mtcars.csv.zip\n  └── whitespace-sample.txt\n\n1 directory, 15 files\n\n\nThese files are used in readr::readr_example() (in R/example.R):\n#' Get path to readr example\n#'\n#' readr comes bundled with a number of sample files in its `inst/extdata`\n#' directory. This function make them easy to access\n#'\n#' @param file Name of file. If `NULL`, the example files will be listed.\n#' @export\n#' @examples\n#' readr_example()\n#' readr_example('challenge.csv')\nreadr_example &lt;- function(file = NULL) {\n  if (is.null(file)) {\n    dir(system.file('extdata', package = 'readr'))\n  } else {\n    system.file('extdata', file, package = 'readr', mustWork = TRUE)\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow system.file() works\nsystem.file() gives us access to the package files on installation (i.e., the files we see at the path above). In the previous chapter, we used system.file() to access the movies.fst file in inst/extdata/:\n\ndplyr::glimpse(  \n  fst::read_fst(path = \n      system.file(\"extdata/\", \"movies.fst\", package = \"pkgApp\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\nshow/hide glimpse() of movies.fstfstcore package v0.9.14\n(OpenMP was not detected, using single threaded mode)\nRows: 651\nColumns: 34\n$ title            &lt;chr&gt; \"Filly Brown\", \"The Dish\", \"Waiting for…\n$ title_type       &lt;fct&gt; Feature Film, Feature Film, Feature Fil…\n$ genre            &lt;fct&gt; Drama, Drama, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Do…\n$ runtime          &lt;dbl&gt; 80, 101, 84, 139, 90, 78, 142, 93, 88, …\n$ mpaa_rating      &lt;fct&gt; R, PG-13, R, PG, R, Unrated, PG-13, R, …\n$ studio           &lt;fct&gt; Indomina Media Inc., Warner Bros.

When a test is run, you’ll see feedback on whether it passes or fails:\n\ntest_that(desc = \"multiplication works\", code = {\n  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)\n})\n\nTest passed 🌈\n\n\nExpectations\nMost expectation have two parts: an observed object, and an expected object. The observed object is an artifact of some code you’ve written, and it’s being compared against a known result (i.e., what is expected)\n\nexpect_equal(\n  object = 2 * 2,\n  expected = 4)\n\nComparisons\nAll tests are based on comparisons, and I’ve found knowing what package is performing the underlying comparison often saves me from surprising tests results.\nFor example, testthat::expect_equal() compares the observed and expected objects with the waldo package, with some help from diffobj.\n\nlibrary(waldo)\nlibrary(diffobj)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\nwaldo\nIf you’d like a preview of a comparison before writing a formal test, you can pass the your observed and expected objects to waldo::compare() to see what the result will be, but be mindful of the difference in argument names:\nFor example, suppose we have two objects: old and new\n\nstr(old)\n## tibble [3 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n##  $ chr: chr [1:3] \"B\" \"C\" \"D\"\n##  $ num: num [1:3] 1 2 3\n##  $ fct: Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"L\"&lt;\"M\"&lt;\"H\": 1 2 3\n\n\nstr(new)\n## 'data.frame':    3 obs. of  3 variables:\n##  $ CHR: chr  \"B\" \"C\" \"D\"\n##  $ num: int  1 2 3\n##  $ fct: Factor w/ 3 levels \"low\",\"med\",\"high\": 1 2 3\n\n\n\n\ncompare(\n  x = old, \n  y = old)\n## ✔ No differences\n\n\ncompare(\n  x = old, \n  y = new)\n## `class(old)`: \"tbl_df\" \"tbl\" \"data.frame\"\n## `class(new)`:                \"data.frame\"\n## \n## `names(old)`: \"chr\" \"num\" \"fct\"\n## `names(new)`: \"CHR\" \"num\" \"fct\"\n## \n## `old$chr` is a character vector ('B', 'C', 'D')\n## `new$chr` is absent\n## \n## `old$num` is a double vector (1, 2, 3)\n## `new$num` is an integer vector (1, 2, 3)\n## \n## `class(old$fct)`: \"ordered\" \"factor\"\n## `class(new$fct)`:           \"factor\"\n## \n## `levels(old$fct)`: \"L\"   \"M\"   \"H\"   \n## `levels(new$fct)`: \"low\" \"med\" \"high\"\n## \n## `old$CHR` is absent\n## `new$CHR` is a character vector ('B', 'C', 'D')\n\n\n\ndiffobj\nIf you’re using Posit Workbench, the diffobj package has a colorful display for making comparisons in the IDE.\nThe differences can be displayed vertically with diffobj::diffObj():\n\n\n\ndiffObj(\n  old, \n  new)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Viewer ouput from diffobj::diffObj()\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to view the structure (str()) differences, you can use diffobj::diffStr():\n\n\n\ndiffStr(\n  old, \n  new)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Viewer ouput from diffobj::diffStr()\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing the old vs new comparisons with waldo and diffobj, you should notice the similarities in the results of a testthat test on the same objects:\n[ FAIL 1 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 0 ]\n\n── Failure (test-old-vs-new.R:18:3): old vs. new ──────────\n`old` (`actual`) not equal to `new` (`expected`).\n\n`class(actual)`:   \"tbl_df\" \"tbl\" \"data.frame\"\n`class(expected)`:                \"data.frame\"\n\n`names(actual)`:   \"chr\" \"num\" \"fct\"\n`names(expected)`: \"CHR\" \"num\" \"fct\"\n\n`actual$chr` is a character vector ('B', 'C', 'D')\n`expected$chr` is absent\n\n`class(actual$fct)`:   \"ordered\" \"factor\"\n`class(expected$fct)`:           \"factor\"\n\n`levels(actual$fct)`:   \"L\"   \"M\"   \"H\"   \n`levels(expected$fct)`: \"low\" \"med\" \"high\"\n\n`actual$CHR` is absent\n`expected$CHR` is a character vector ('B', 'C', 'D')\n[ FAIL 1 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 0 ]\nSnapshots\nWriting tests for graph outputs can be difficult, because we’re evaluating the output from a custom plotting function like scatter_plot().

The primary difference between lintr and styler is that styler can automatically fix any stylistic issues it identifies in your code (rather than just reporting them).\nlintr: lintr is a static code analysis tool used to identify syntax errors, semantic issues, and violations of stylistic guidelines in your code. The package contains a list of ‘linters’ for various potential problems and can be customized according to your needs. lintr is designed to help improve your code’s quality and readability by generating reports in the ‘markers’ pane. Running lintr won’t automatically correct the identified issues (you’ll need to fix the linting issues it reports manually).\nstyler: On the other hand, the purpose of styler is to ensure consistency in the code formatting, which is crucial if you’re working in a team or contributing to open-source projects (like tidyverse packages). The styler package will change your code’s format according to specified style guidelines. These changes include indentation, spaces, and line breaks that adhere to your style guidelines.\nWhile there is some overlap (both packages can help enforce coding style guidelines), lintr is a more general tool for code quality, spotting potential issues and bugs. At the same time, styler focuses on code formatting and can automatically apply fixes. Many developers find combining both can help catch potential issues and ensure a consistent, readable coding style."

It was initially created using the New Project Wizard (with a Git repo initialized).\nIf you’re new to GitHub, the steps below will walk you through setting up Git and GitHub from RStudio using the Git pane. The initial files in the project are below:\nprojApp/\n  ├── app.R\n  └── projApp.Rproj\n\n1 directory, 2 files\nAfter creating the project, head over to GitHub and create am empty repo. You’ll see the following options:\n\n\n\n\n(a) New repository on GitHub\n\nFigure 1: Empty GitHub repository options\n\n\nWe’re interested in the second option, “…push an existing repository from the command line”, but we’re going to use Posit Workbench’s Git pane.\nCommit\nCommit these initial changes to the repo using the Commit icon in the Git pane\n\n\n\n(a) Commit changes\n\n\n\n(b) First commit\n\nFigure 2: Click on Commit to open the Git window. Stage all the files, add a commit message, and click Commit\n\nAdd a commit message and click Commit. This is the equivalent of entering the following commands in the Terminal:\ngit commit -m 'first commit'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit changes in your repository with a specific message\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit commit -m 'first commit'\n\ngit commit: This command captures a snapshot of the changes in your project’s tracked files and directories. By committing, you’re saving the current state of those files in the Git repository.\n-m: This flag indicates that a commit message will be provided directly from the command line.\n'first commit': This is the commit message associated with this commit. Commit messages are useful for documenting the changes you’ve made, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand the evolution and purpose of changes in the project.\n\nWhen you run git commit -m 'first commit', you are committing your staged changes (i.e., changes you’ve previously added to the staging area using git add) with the message ‘first commit’.\nThis message is then stored in the Git history, allowing anyone who looks at the commit logs to see a brief description of what was done in that particular commit.\n\n\n\n\nReview the output from the commit.\n\n\n\n(a) First commit output\n\nFigure 3: The .gitignore, app.R, and projApp.Rproj files have been committed to main\n\nThis shows the contents of projApp are part of the main branch. Now we need to make sure the local branch has a remote (on GitHub at https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/projApp.git).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the currently checked-out branch to main\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command git branch -M main is used to rename the currently checked-out branch to main.\nHere’s a breakdown of the command:\n\ngit branch: This command without any arguments would list all the local branches in the current repository. But, with certain options (like -M), you can perform other branch-related operations.\n-M: This option stands for ‘move/rename’ and forcibly renames the branch. If a branch named main already exists, it will be overwritten because of the forceful nature of the -M option. If you want to avoid accidentally overwriting an existing branch, you could use -m (lowercase) instead. The lowercase -m will rename only if the target name doesn’t already exist.\nmain: This is the new name for the currently checked-out branch.\n\nThe command became more common after the industry started transitioning from using master to main as the default branch name for new repositories. Running git branch -M main is a way to rename the master branch to main in existing repositories.\n\n\n\n\nAdding remotes\nClick the New Branch icon in the Git pane and create a new main branch. Then click on Add Remote… and name the remote origin.\n\n\n\n(a) Add branch and remote name\n\n\n\n(b) Add remote URL\n\nFigure 4: Create new main branch to track origin\n\nThe Remote URL is the link from the Quick Setup above. After clicking Add and Create, you’ll be asked to checkout or overwrite the existing main branch. In this case, we can select Overwrite (because we’re already on the main branch).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new remote to your Git repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git\n\ngit remote: used to manage and set remotes (‘remote repositories’) for your project\nadd: specifies that you want to add a new remote.\norigin: a convention widely used in the Git community is to name the primary remote repository origin.\nhttps://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git: This is the URL to the Git repository (hosted on GitHub). Replace &lt;username&gt; with the GitHub username of the repository owner and &lt;repo&gt; with the name of the repository.\n\nSo, when you run this command, you’re telling Git: ‘I want to add a new remote called origin, and the URL for this remote is https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git'.’\nAfter executing this command, you can then push to and pull from the repository using this remote by referring to its name (origin). For instance, git push origin master would push your local master branch to the master branch on the origin remote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Overwrite main\n\n\n\n(b) branch main set up to track origin/main\n\nFigure 5: main will now track the remote (origin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush a local branch (main) to a remote (origin), and set local branch to track remote branch\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit push -u origin main\n\ngit push: used to push commits from your local repository to a remote repository.\norigin: name of the remote repository you want to push to. When you clone a repo or add a remote using git remote add, it’s common to name the main remote origin (though it could technically be any name).\nmain: name of the branch you’re pushing to the remote repository.\n-u or --set-upstream: When this option is used, it sets a tracking relationship between the local and upstream remote branches. This means that in the future, using git pull or git push doesn’t require specifying the remote or branch (Git will know you’re referring to the origin/main branch).\n\nIn essence, git push -u origin main is saying: ‘Push my ’main’ branch to the ‘origin’ remote, and also set my local ‘main’ branch to track the ‘main’ branch on ‘origin’.\nThe common workflow for setting up Git from the command line is below:\n# make changes \ngit add .\ngit commit 'first commit'\n# set remote on GitHub\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git\n# rename the current branch to main\ngit branch -M main\n# push and set upstream to origin (remote)\ngit push -u origin main"

Maybe you’ve investigated using a framework (like golem or rhino) but can’t decide if their features will fit your needs.\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, you’re in the perfect position to create a new package with usethis::create_package() or devtools::create(). If you’re using Posit Workbench, do File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; R Package.\nScenario #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario #2: Convert a working app project into an app-package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe app is currently deployed and is being accessed by users, but the underlying code lives in the ‘root’ folder (i.e., an app.R or ui.R and server.R, global.R, helper.R, and/or other .R files, data, static resources, etc.). The application works, but you’d like to convert it to a package structure without breaking it.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a circumstance where I’d manually create the DESCRIPTION file (or use usethis::use_description()) and set the package-level build tools (Tools &gt; Project options &gt; Build Tools &gt; Project build tools). Then I’d begin organizing the shiny app files into a package structure (i.e., move .R files into the R/ folder, data files into the data/ folder, etc.)\nScenario #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario #3: Convert a legacy app project into a shiny app-package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe app was written some time ago, used superseded or deprecated functions (i.e., callModule()), and needs updating. Updating the apps might include adding data or static resources, writing utility functions and modules, etc.\nThe critical distinction is that this application is not working and requires updates.\n\n\n\n\nScenario #4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario #4: Convert your ‘dev’ app project into an app-package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re currently developing an app project, and you read somewhere it should be an app-package; however, you can’t find clear instructions on how to accomplish this incrementally.\nAnd maybe you’re a minimalist (like me) who likes to have complete control over every aspect of the development process."
