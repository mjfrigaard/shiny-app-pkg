[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers ensure your Shiny applications are deployed with the necessary tools and resources (dependencies, libraries, etc.) without significantly interfering with the native operating system or hardware.

With Docker, each Shiny application runs from an *image* in an isolated *container*, which ensures your app works consistently, regardless of where it's deployed.[^docker-documentation]

[^docker-documentation]: Read more about Docker in the [official documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/)

## What is Docker?

Two terms to know when working with Docker are **container** and **image**. Containers and images work together but they serve different purposes in the Docker ecosystem.

**Image**: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable file that includes everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

**Containers**: A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. When you run an image, Docker creates a container from that image. A Docker image can exist without a container, but all containers must be instantiated from an image.

### How they work

Imagine your computer as a building. In this building, your operating system (OS) is like a big kitchen where everyone cooks. If someone (a software application) needs the oven at a specific temperature or requires a particular ingredient, this can interfere with what someone else (i.e., other applications) wants to cook. This situation is somewhat analogous to the competition for resources software applications can have while running on a particular machine. 

Docker containers are like individual, self-contained mini-kitchens containing appliances, ingredients, and utensils. Each mini-kitchen can operate independently, regardless of what's happening in the others. Docker images can contain different 'recipes' for software applications, and each application can have different requirements (dependencies, libraries, versions, etc.).[^docker-not-vm]

[^docker-not-vm]: Docker containers are similar to virtual machine environments (like [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/)), but don't use a significant portion of the hardware system’s resources.

Docker images are created through a `build` process, which uses a `Dockerfile` (a text file containing a series of instructions) to define how the image should be constructed. For a Shiny app, all of the application's dependencies are stored inside the container, which ensures consistency across environments. The container also isolates the image (and the application) from the host system. 

## Installing Docker 

Follow the instructions found on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker Desktop. I'll be demonstrating how to use Docker on a macOS (but it's available on most operating systems).

After installation, Docker Desktop will initially show no active images/containers:[^initial-docker]

[^initial-docker]: If you follow the Docker 'Walkthroughs' in the Learning Center, you might see the `welcome-to-docker` container listed.

![Docker Desktop Containers (Mac)](images/docker_desktop.png){width=100% fig-align='center'}

After installing Docker, the development process for your Shiny app-package doesn't change until you're ready to deploy your application. 

## The `Dockerfile`

We'll be using the `moviesApp` example from the previous chapter as an example (the folder/file structure is below):

```{r}
#| label: git_box_15_docker
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  contents = "launch",
  fig_pw = '50%', 
  branch = "15_docker", 
  repo = 'moviesApp')
```


```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: 'view app-package folder tree'

When our application is ready to deploy, we'll create a `Dockerfile`, which is a plain-text file (no extension). `Dockerfile`s are a blend of commands, numeric values, and character strings with the following general conventions: 

1. **Each line in the `Dockerfile` starts with an instruction**. These aren't case-sensitive, but it's common practice to capitalize each command.

2. **Comments or explanatory notes begin with `#`**. These will be ignored by the Docker engine.

Below are two lines from the `Dockerfile` found in the excellent post titled, [R Shiny Docker: How To Run Shiny Apps in a Docker Container](https://appsilon.com/r-shiny-docker-getting-started/). This is a great place to familiarize yourself with deploying a non-package Shiny application with Docker.[^appsilon-docker-intro]

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
# build image 
FROM rocker/shiny

# create location for app
RUN mkdir /home/shiny-app
```

[^appsilon-docker-intro]: I've altered the comments of the original `Dockerfile`, so be sure to read the entire blog post before copying + pasting this into your workflow.

As you can see, the `Dockerfile` combines instructions (`FROM`, `RUN`) with command-line arguments (`mkdir`). You don't have to be a command-line expert to write a Dockerfile (but knowing a few can get you out of a jam [^linuxize-resource]).

[^linuxize-resource]: I love the help files on [https://linuxize.com/](https://linuxize.com/), and [this tutorial](https://command-line-tutorial.readthedocs.io/index.html) is a nice introduction to the command-line.

### Create image 

Docker files start by building an image. In our case, we want an image configured to run R, which has been provided for us by the generous folks at the [`rocker` project](https://rocker-project.org/).

The Shiny `rocker` image is for Shiny apps: 

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
FROM rocker/shiny
```

### Install dependencies 

Use `RUN` and `R -e` to install dependencies for our app in the container from CRAN.[^remotes-install-local]

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: scroll
RUN R -e 'install.packages(c("rlang", "stringr", "shiny", "ggplot2", "remotes"))'
```

[^remotes-install-local]: We'll need remotes to install our app-package locally (i.e., with `remotes::install_local(upgrade="never")`).

### Create location for app

1. `RUN mkdir` creates a new `/deploy` directory in the container

2. `ADD . /deploy` copies the files from the current directory (on the host machine) into the `/deploy` directory inside the container

3. `WORKDIR /deploy` sets the `/deploy` directory as the working directory for any subsequent instructions.

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
RUN mkdir /deploy
ADD . /deploy
WORKDIR /deploy
```

### Install app-package

`remotes::install_local()` will the R package specified in the local directory (where our Shiny app-package lives), without upgrading dependencies.

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_local(upgrade="never")'
```

### Clean up 

`RUN rm -rf /deploy` cleans up and reduces the size of the container.

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
RUN rm -rf /deploy
```

### Expose port 

Make our Shiny app available on `EXPOSE 8180`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
EXPOSE 8180
```

### Launch app 

When the container starts, set Shiny to listen on port `8180`, then launch the Shiny app from our `moviesApp` package. The port we exposed in the `Dockerfile` should match the `shiny.port` option.

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: scroll
CMD R -e "options('shiny.port'=8180,shiny.host='0.0.0.0');library(moviesApp);moviesApp::movies_app()"
```

## Build image

The final `Dockerfile` we'll use to launch our application is below: 

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: scroll
FROM rocker/shiny
RUN R -e 'install.packages(c("rlang", "stringr", "shiny", "ggplot2", "remotes"))'
RUN mkdir /deploy
ADD . /deploy
WORKDIR /deploy
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_local(upgrade="never")'
RUN rm -rf /deploy
EXPOSE 8180
CMD R -e "options('shiny.port'=8180,shiny.host='0.0.0.0');library(moviesApp);moviesApp::movies_app()"
```

To build the Docker image and create a new container, run the `docker build` command in the Terminal with a tag (`-t`), a name for the image (`movies-app-docker-demo`), and the location (`.`): 

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
docker build -t movies-app-docker-demo .
```

As the docker image builds you'll see the output in the Terminal:

![](images/docker_build.png){width=100% fig-align='center'}

After the image is built, we'll see a new container listed in Docker desktop:

![](images/docker_deployed_container.png){width=100% fig-align='center'}

New Docker containers are named using a random combination of adjectives and famous scientists' surnames (unless the `--name` flag is added). Change the name of a Docker image  with `docker rename <old_name> <new_name>`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
docker rename great_yalow movies_app
```

### Running the container

After building the image, we can run the new container using `docker run`

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
docker run -p 8180:8180 movies-app-docker-demo
```

In the Terminal, we'll see an R session initialize, and the R function calls from the last line of our `Dockerfile`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: scroll

Each Docker container is created from the image (which is specified in the `Dockerfile`). The image serves as a blueprint for the containers, and we could create multiple containers from the same image:

## Docker & `golem`

The `golem` package has [multiple functions](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/reference/index.html#create-a-dockerfile) for building Docker files and images. There are a few notable points to make about some of the Docker images created with `golem`: 

-   `golem`'s Docker functions can produce multiple Docker files (`golem::add_dockerfile_with_renv()` creates a `tmp/deploy` folder and adds the following files)

    ```{bash}
    #| eval: false 
    #| code-fold: show
    #| code-summary: 'View deploy/ folder'
    deploy/
      ├── Dockerfile
      ├── Dockerfile_base
      ├── README
      ├── gap_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz
      └── renv.lock.prod
    ```

-   `golem`'s Docker files typically use the R build from `rocker` (and include a version):

    ```{bash}
    #| eval: false 
    #| code-fold: show
    #| code-summary: 'View R version build'
    FROM rocker/verse:4.3.2
    ```

-   `golem` Docker files might also include additional commands for installing/updating command-line (linux) tools for downloading/exchanging data: 

    ```{bash}
    #| eval: false 
    #| code-fold: show
    #| code-summary: 'View apt-get commands'
    #| code-overflow: scroll
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y  libcurl4-openssl-dev libicu-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev make pandoc zlib1g-dev
    ```

-   They also usually the `remotes` package to specify the `version` of each package and whether to `upgrade` (or not):

    ```{bash}
    #| eval: false 
    #| code-fold: show
    #| code-summary: 'View remotes::install_version()'
    #| code-overflow: scroll
    RUN R -e 'install.packages("remotes")'
    RUN Rscript -e 'remotes::install_version("rlang",upgrade="never",version="1.1.2")'
    RUN Rscript -e 'remotes::install_version("stringr",upgrade="never",version="1.5.1")'
    RUN Rscript -e 'remotes::install_version("shiny",upgrade="never",version ="1.8.0")'
    RUN Rscript -e 'remotes::install_version("ggplot2",upgrade="never",version="3.4.4")'
    ```
    
```{r}
#| label: co_box_run_e_rscript_comparison
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "g", 
  fold = FALSE,
  look = "default", 
  hsize = '1.15', 
  size = '1.02',
  header = "**`RUN R -e`** vs **`RUN Rscript -e`**",
  contents = "
Both `R -e` and `RUN Rscript -e` will execute R expressions from the command line. 
  
-  `R -e` is straightforward and typically used to evaluate a single expression (i.e., `install.packages()`)
  
- `RUN Rscript -e` is more commonly used for running scripts or more specialized commands: 
  
\`\`\`r
pkgs <- c('glue', 'cli')
install.packages(pkgs)
\`\`\`

  "
)
```
    
There are additional differences, but these are important if you want to include additional requirements or control the version of R (or a package dependency). `golem`'s Docker images are more (you guessed it) opinionated, but every time I've used one it works right "out of the box."

## Docker in app-packages

You can include a `Dockerfile` in an app-package by adding it to the `.Rbuildignore` file.[^rbuildignore]

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
^.*\.Rproj$
^\.Rproj\.user$
^moviesApp\.Rcheck$
^moviesApp.*\.tar\.gz$
^moviesApp.*\.tgz$
^Dockerfile$
```

This will ensure it won't interfere with your app-package builds. Docker also has it's own ignore file (`.dockerignore`), which can include similar contents to the `.gitignore`: 

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
.RData
.Rhistory
.git
.gitignore
manifest.json
rsconnect/
.Rproj.user
```

Note that if you include a `.dockerignore` file, you should *also* include this pattern in the `.Rbuildignore`: 

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
^.*\.Rproj$
^\.Rproj\.user$
^moviesApp\.Rcheck$
^moviesApp.*\.tar\.gz$
^moviesApp.*\.tgz$
^Dockerfile$
^\.dockerignore$
```

[^rbuildignore]: `.Rbuildignore` includes files that we need to have in our app-package, but don't conform to the standard R package structure (and shouldn't be included when building our app-package from the source files).

## Recap

This has been a brief overview of using Docker to deploy your Shiny App-Package. Docker files are used to build images, which defines an environment for the Shiny application to run. The container is the actual running instance of that environment.

- Docker images are immutable, meaning they do not change. Once an image is created, it remains unchanged inside a container.

- Docker containers can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted, but each time a container is run, it's created from an image. 

Docker is covered again in the [`golem` chapter](golem.qmd) and on the Shiny frameworks [supplemental website](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/sfw/golem.html#docker). If you'd like to learn more, Appsilon has a great introduction to Docker (mentioned above).[^appsilon-docker-guide] I also found the Dockerizing shiny applications post helpful.
