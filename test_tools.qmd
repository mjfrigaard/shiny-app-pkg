This chapter introduces tools to help write clean and efficient tests. These files, folders and methods can be included in our app-package test suite and are described in-depth in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#sec-testing-design-principles), and the [`testthat` documentation.](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html) (but within the context of a standard R package). The sections below contain examples of each tool implemented in an app-package.

## Testing best practices

One of the motivations for developing a Shiny application in an R package is the ability to test your code. R packages have a well-established framework for testing (`testthat`), which allows us to write and run unit tests. At the time of this writing, the second edition of R Packages also dedicates three chapters to testing.[^test_tools-1]

[^test_tools-1]: The three chapters in R Packages, 2ed, dedicated to testing are [Testing basics](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html), [Designing your test suite](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html), and [Advanced testing techniques](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html)

### Test scope

One of the recent updates to the `testthat` package (version 3.2.0) emphasizes limiting code that exists outside of our tests.[^test_tools-2]

[^test_tools-2]: Read a summary of the changes to the `testthat` package on the [tidyverse blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/10/testthat-3-2-0/)

> "*Eliminating (or at least minimizing) top-level code outside of `test_that()` will have the beneficial effect of making your tests more hermetic. This is basically the testing analogue of the general programming advice that it's wise to avoid unstructured sharing of state.*" - [Self-sufficient tests, R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#self-sufficient-tests)

The code outside of `test_that()` usually serves a specific purpose: functions called to load, create, or manipulate data; setting options; creating folders or files; databases connections; etc. The topics in this chapter will demonstrate how to include these behaviors in our tests while adhering to the advice above by properly using test fixtures, helpers, and mocks.

### BDD refresher: features & scenarios

In BDD, requirements are written plain language 'feature files' using a series of keywords:   

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
Feature: # <1>
  # <1>
  Background: # <2>
    Given # <3> 
    
  Scenario: # <4>
    When # <5>
    And # <6> 
    Then # <7>
    # <4>
```
1. **High-level description** (title and description)  
2. Steps or conditions that exist **before each scenario**   
3. Used to **describe the initial context** or **preconditions for the scenario**      
4. A series of steps outlining a **concrete examples that illustrates a feature**   
5. Used to **describe an event, or an action**  
6. Use to combine **`Given`**, **`When`**, or **`Then`**     
7. Use to **verify expected outcomes that are observable by a user**  

`Feature`, `Background`, and `Scenario` information can be included in nested `testthat::describe()` blocks, but every `Then` keyword should have a corresponding `testthat::it()` call.

## Test fixtures

<!-- https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/self-cleaning-test-fixtures/ -->

The two principles to keep in mind while developing test fixtures, helpers, and mocks in an app-package are:

1.  Keep test scope logic defined to a single test (or all tests)

2.  Explicitly setup and tear down anything created during a test (and reset test state between each test run)

Test fixtures can be anything used to create repeatable test conditions (data, file paths, functions, etc.). Good test fixtures provide a consistent, well-defined test environment, and then are removed/destroyed when the test is executed. This ensures any changes made during the test don't persist or interfere with future tests.[^test_tools-5]

[^test_tools-5]: For a concrete example, see [this article](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/self-cleaning-test-fixtures/) on self-cleaning tests.

In R packages, test fixtures are stored in the `tests/testthat/fixtures/` folder:[^tests-fixtures-folder-name]

[^tests-fixtures-folder-name]: The name '`fixtures`' isn't required (you can name this folder anything).

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
tests/
├── testthat/
│   └── fixtures/                                         
└── testthat.R
```



### Test data

Large static data files are an example of a test fixture.[^test_tools-6] Any code used to create test data should be stored with the output file (using a clear naming convention).

[^test_tools-6]: Creating a tidied version of `ggplot2movies::movies` would be costly to re-create with every test, so it's advised to store it as an [static test fixture.](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html#sec-testing-advanced-concrete-fixture)

For example, I've stored the code used to create a ['tidy' version](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp/blob/10b_tests-helpers-fixtures/tests/testthat/fixtures/make-ggp2_movies.R) of the `ggplot2movies::movies` data along with the output dataset in `tests/testthat/fixtures/`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
tests
├── testthat
│   ├── fixtures
│   │   ├── make-tidy_ggp2_movies # <1>
│   │   └── tidy_ggp2_movies.rds # <2>
│   └── test-<name>.R
└── testthat.R

3 directories, 4 files
```

1.  The code used to create the test data (`make-make_tidy_ggp2_movies.R`)
2.  The test data file (i.e., `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds`):

Data files stored in `tests/testthat/fixtures/` can be accessed with `testthat::test_path()` inside each test.

### Example: test fixture

Below is a test that answers the question, '*does the plot generate without producing an error?*' when using the `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds` test fixture with the `scatter_plot()` utility function. This type of test appropriate because we want to confirm the data source (`tidy_ggp2_movies`) will generate a plot object when passed to the `scatter_plot()` utility function, not necessarily the specific contents of the graph.[^test_tools-is.ggplot]

[^test_tools-is.ggplot]: Snapshot tests would be more appropriate for answering the question, ['*is the plot visually correct?*'](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/server-function-testing/index.html#complex-outputs-plots-htmlwidgets).

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
testthat::describe( # <1>
    "Feature: Scatter plot data visualization

      testthat::it( # <2>
        "Scenario: Create scatter plot

                set of continuous and categorical columns.", 
          code = { # <2>
        
        ggp2_scatter_inputs <- list(  # <3>
          x = "rating",
          y = "length",
          z = "mpaa",
          alpha = 0.75,
          size = 3,
          plot_title = "Enter plot title"
        )              # <3>
        
    tidy_ggp2_movies <- readRDS(test_path("fixtures", # <4>
                                "tidy_ggp2_movies.rds")) # <4>
    app_graph <- scatter_plot(tidy_ggp2_movies,  # <5>
      x_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$x,
      y_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$y,
      col_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$z,
      alpha_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$alpha,
      size_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$size
    ) # <5>
    expect_true(ggplot2::is.ggplot(app_graph)) # <6> 
  }) # <2>

}) # <1>
```

1.  Functional requirement\
2.  Test code\
3.  Test inputs\
4.  Test fixture\
5.  Create observed object\
6.  Expectation

#### Test development 

While developing, using keyboard shortcuts makes it easier to iterate between building fixtures, writing and running tests, and checking code coverage.

```{r}
#| label: hot_key_tf_01
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
hot_key(fun = 'tf')
```

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
devtools:::test_active_file()
[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 1 ]
```

```{r}
#| label: hot_key_cf_01
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
hot_key(fun = 'cf')
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
devtools:::test_coverage_active_file()
```

![Test coverage on active file](img/11_tests_coverage_scatter_plot.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| label: git_box_10b_tests-fixtures
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "10b_tests-fixtures", 
  repo = 'moviesApp')
```

If the data `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds` in `tests/testthat/fixtures/` are going to be used repeatedly, it might also make sense to store it in `inst/extdata/` or `data-raw/`. Test fixtures are described in-depth in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html#test-fixtures) and in the [`testthat` documentation](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/test-fixtures.html#test-fixtures).

## Test helpers

<!-- https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#testthat-helper-files -->

> "*Helper files are a mighty weapon in the battle to eliminate code floating around at the top-level of test files.*" Testthat helper files, [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#testthat-helper-files)

Test helpers reduce repeated/duplicated test code. In general, objects or values that aren't large enough to justify storing as static test fixtures can be created with helper functions. Helper functions are stored in `tests/testthat/helper.R`, which is automatically loaded with `devtools::load_all()`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
tests/
  ├── testthat/
  │   ├── fixtures/                                         # <1>
  │   │   ├── make-tidy_ggp2_movies.R
  │   │   └── tidy_ggp2_movies.rds
  │   ├── helper.R                                          # <2>
  │   └── test-<name>.R                                     # <3>
  └── testthat.R
```

1.  Test fixture scripts and `.rds` files\
2.  Helper functions\
3.  Test file

Test helpers should only be created if they make testing easier **when the tests fail.** The article, ['Why Good Developers Write Bad Unit Tests'](https://mtlynch.io/good-developers-bad-tests/), provides great advice on complexity vs. clarity when writing unit tests,

> *'think about what will make the problem obvious when a test fails. Refactoring may reduce duplication, but it also increases complexity and potentially obscures information when things break.'*

R programmers resist copy + paste programming, and in most cases this makes sense. After all, R *is* a functional programming language, so it's tempting to bundle any repeated code into a function and store it in the `tests/testthat/helper.R` file.

However, when we're writing tests, it's more important that tests are easy to read and understand **when they fail**.

For example, consider the `tidy_ggp2_movies` inputs passed to the `scatter_plot()` function in the previous test:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
ggp2_scatter_inputs <- list(  
        x = "rating",
        y = "length",
        z = "mpaa",
        alpha = 0.75,
        size = 3,
        plot_title = "Enter plot title"
)            
```

We could write a `var_inputs()` function that stores these values in a list. In our tests, this would allow us to use `var_inputs()` with the same 'reactive syntax' we use with `scatter_plot()` in the module server function:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: false 
#| collapse: true
var_inputs <- function() {
   list( x = "rating",
        y = "length",
        z = "mpaa",
        alpha = 0.75,
        size = 3,
        plot_title = "Enter plot title"
    )
}
var_inputs()
```

While this removes duplicated code, it also makes it less clear for the reader what `var_inputs()` contains and where it was created (without opening the `helper.R` file).

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
#| collapse: true
testthat::it(
  "Scenario: Create scatter plot
    Given I have launched the movie review exploration app,
    When I view the scatter plot,
    Then I should see points representing values for a default
         set of continuous and categorical columns.", code = {
           
    tidy_ggp2_movies <- readRDS(test_path("fixtures", # <1>
                                "tidy_ggp2_movies.rds")) # <1>
  
app_graph <- scatter_plot(
  tidy_ggp2_movies,
  x_var = var_inputs()$x, # <2>
  y_var = var_inputs()$y,
  col_var = var_inputs()$z,
  alpha_var = var_inputs()$alpha,
  size_var = var_inputs()$size) # <2>

testthat::expect_true(ggplot2::is.ggplot(app_graph))
})
```
1. Load test fixture  
2. This is how we refer to the inputs in `mod_scatter_display_server()`


```{r}
#| label: co_box_dry
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "r", 
  fold = FALSE,
  look = 'simple',
  size = "1.05", 
  hsize = "1.15",
  header = "Violating the DRY principle",
  contents = "
If you have repeated code in your tests, consider the following questions below before creating a helper function: 
  
1. Does the code help explain what behavior is being tested? 
  
2. Would a helper make it harder to debug the test when it fails?  
  
It’s more important that test code is obvious than DRY, because it’s more likely you’ll be dealing with this test when it fails (and you're not likely to remember why all the top-level code is there).
  
"
)
```

In contrast, the `make_ggp2_inputs()` function below creates inputs for the `scatter_plot()` utility function:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
make_ggp2_inputs <- function() {
  glue::glue_collapse("list(x = 'rating',
     y = 'length',
     z = 'mpaa',
     alpha = 0.75,
     size = 3,
     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'
     )"
  )
}
```

I can call `make_ggp2_inputs()` in the **Console** and it will return the list of values to paste into each test:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
make_ggp2_inputs()
list(y = 'audience_score', 
     x = 'imdb_rating',
     z = 'mpaa_rating',
     alpha = 0.5,
     size = 2,
     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'
    )
```

This reduces the number of keystrokes per test, but doesn't obscure the source of the values in the test.

`glue::glue_collapse()` is your friend when you want to quickly reproduce code for your tests. `make_var_inputs()` creates the list of inputs for testing the original `movies` data:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: false 
make_var_inputs <- function() {
  glue::glue_collapse("list(y = 'audience_score', 
     x = 'imdb_rating',
     z = 'mpaa_rating',
     alpha = 0.5,
     size = 2,
     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'
    )")
}
```

#### Logging

I prefer test outputs to be verbose, so I usually create a `test_logger()` helper function that allows me to give more context and information with each test:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: true
# test logger helper
test_logger <- function(start = NULL, end = NULL, msg) {
  if (is.null(start) & is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("{msg}")
  } else if (!is.null(start) & is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("\n[ START {start} = {msg}]")
  } else if (is.null(start) & !is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("\n[ END {end} = {msg}]")
  } else {
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("\n[ START {start} = {msg}]")
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("\n[ END {end} = {msg}]")
  }
}
```

`test_logger()` can be used to 'log' the `start` and `end` of each test, and it includes a message argument (`msg`) I'll use to reference the test `description` argument in each `it()` call.[^test_tools-logging]

[^test_tools-logging]: If you like verbose logging outputs, check out the [`logger` package](https://daroczig.github.io/logger/)

I tend to use functions like `test_logger()` enough to justify placing them in a testing utility file ([`R/testthat.R`](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp/blob/10c_tests-helpers/R/testthat.R)) below `R/`. Including testing functions in the `R/` folder also ensures they're documented and any dependencies become part of your app-package).[^test_tools-helpers-r-dir]

[^test_tools-helpers-r-dir]: Placing common files for testing below `R/` is covered in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#hiding-in-plain-sight-files-below-r)

#### Example: snapshots

Writing tests for graph outputs can be difficult because the "correctness" of a graph is somewhat subjective and requires human judgment. If the expected output we're interesting in testing is cumbersome to describe programmatically, we can consider using a snapshot tests. Examples of this include UI elements (which are mostly HTML created by Shiny's UI layout and input/output functions) and data visualizations.[^test_tools-snapshot-advice]

[^test_tools-snapshot-advice]: Mastering Shiny covers [creatng a snapshot file](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-testing.html#user-interface-functions) to test UI elements, but also notes this is probably not the best approach.

If we want to create a graph snapshot test, the [`vdiffr`](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/) package allows us to perform a 'visual unit test' by capturing the expected output as an `.svg` file that we can compare with future versions.

The `expect_doppelganger()` function from `vdiffr` is designed specifically to work with ['graphical plots'](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/reference/expect_doppelganger.html).

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
vdiffr::expect_doppelganger(
      title = "name of graph", 
      fig = # ...code to create graph...
  )
```

Another option for using snapshots for testing is the `expect_snapshot_file()` function [^test_tools-12] but `expect_doppelganger()` is probably the better option for comparing graph outputs.

[^test_tools-12]: Follow the `expect_snapshot_file()` example from the [`testthat` documentation](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_snapshot_file.html#ref-examples)

In this test, I'll list feature **F1.2** from the traceability matrix in a top-level `describe()` block, then nest each scenario for the functional requirement in `it()` statements (with each snapshot the test will capture).

```{r}
#| label: co_box_trace_matrix_feat_funct_snaps
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false
#| include: true
trace_matrix <- tibble::tibble(
  `Features` = c(
    "F1.2: Dropdown menus (continuous x & y axes, categorical point coloration)",
    NA_character_,
    NA_character_,
    NA_character_
  ),
  `Requirements` = c(
    "FR 1.2: The app should display dropdown menus listing available continuous variables for x-axis and y-axis selection.",
    "FR 1.3: Upon user selection of x-axis and y-axis variables, the app should update the scatter plot to reflect the user’s choices.",
    "FR 1.4: The app should present a dropdown menu listing available categorical variables for point coloration.",
    "FR 1.5: The app should dynamically change the color of points in the scatter plot based on the user’s categorical variable selection."
  )
) 
trace_matrix |> 
  gt::gt(auto_align = TRUE) |> 
  gt::sub_missing(
  columns = gt::everything(),
  rows = gt::everything(),
  missing_text = "-"
)
```

Combining functional requirements in the same test file is helpful if we're trying to keep a 1:1 between the `test/testthat/` file names and file names in `R/`.[^test_tools-13]

[^test_tools-13]: matching files names between `R/` and `tests/testthat/` keeps our code organized and ensures the `devtools::test_coverage_active_file()` function [works.](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/special-files.html)

In this test, I've separated the scenarios into different `it()` sections, and the test results return the output from `test_logger()` for more context of what's being tested:

We also see a warning when the snapshot has been saved in the `tests/testthat/_snaps/` folder the first time the test is run:

On subsequent runs, this warning will disappear (as long as there are no changes to the `.svg` files). We should also update the traceability matrix with the tests we've used to verify the functional requirements:

#### Advice on snapshots

Snapshots are brittle. The term "brittle" in the context of testing refers to a susceptibility to fail with small changes. Brittleness can produce false negatives test failures (i.e., due to inconsequential changes in the graph) when comparing a new graph to the baseline image.

Below is the output from `diffobj::diffObj()` comparing our custom plotting function (`scatter_plot()`) against a graph built with analogous `ggplot2` code:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
ggp_graph <- ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, 
              ggplot2::aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + 
              ggplot2::geom_point(
                ggplot2::aes(color = cyl), 
                             alpha = 0.5, 
                             size = 3)
  
app_graph <- scatter_plot(mtcars, 
                  x_var = "mpg", 
                  y_var = "disp", 
                  col_var = "cyl", 
                  alpha_var = 0.5, 
                  size_var = 3)

diffobj::diffObj(ggp_graph, app_graph)
```

Graph objects are difficult to use as test objects

The output shows us all the potential points of failure when comparing complex objects like graphs (despite the actual outputs appearing identical), so it's best to limit the number of 'visual unit tests' unless they're absolutely necessary.

```{r}
#| label: git_box_10c_tests-helpers
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "10c_tests-helpers", 
  repo = 'moviesApp')
```

## Test mocks

Test code may rely on external systems, behavior, functions, or objects. To ensure that unit tests remain fast and focused solely on the functional requirement being tests, it's important to minimize these external dependencies.

Within the `testthat` context, mocks can be employed to substitute dependencies by emulating the behavior that the external dependency provides. In BDD terms, mocks are creating the `Given` conditions:

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false

```

Assume I've converted the data manipulation steps for creating a tidy `ggplot2movies` dataset into two functions (one using `base` R, the other using `tidyverse` functions). 



Instead of real-time computations, mocks return predefined responses to given inputs.

By mocking functions, developers can craft unit tests in `testthat` that rigorously evaluate a single, specific behavior.

```{r}
#| label: co_box_app_recap
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "b",
  header = "Recap: test suite",
  contents = "
