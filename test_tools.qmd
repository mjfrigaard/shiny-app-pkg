This chapter introduces tools to help write clean and efficient tests. These files, folders and methods can be included in our app-package test suite and are described in-depth in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#sec-testing-design-principles), and the [`testthat` documentation.](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html) (but within the context of a standard R package). The sections below contain examples of each tool implemented in our app-package.[^test_tools-1]

[^test_tools-1]: The three chapters in R Packages, 2ed, dedicated to testing are [Testing basics](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html), [Designing your test suite](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html), and [Advanced testing techniques](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html)

## Test scope

One of the recent updates to the `testthat` package (version 3.2.0) emphasizes limiting code that exists outside of our tests.[^test_tools-2]

[^test_tools-2]: Read a summary of the changes to the `testthat` package on the [tidyverse blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/10/testthat-3-2-0/)

> "*Eliminating (or at least minimizing) top-level code outside of `test_that()` will have the beneficial effect of making your tests more hermetic. This is basically the testing analogue of the general programming advice that it's wise to avoid unstructured sharing of state.*" - [Self-sufficient tests, R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#self-sufficient-tests)

Code outside of `test_that()` usually serves a specific purpose (load or manipulate data, set options, create folders or files, etc). The topics in this chapter will demonstrate how to include these behaviors in our tests without placing code outside of the test scope.

```{r}
#| label: co_box_Mocking
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "b", fold = TRUE, 
  size = "1.05", look = "simple",
  header = "Mocking",
  contents = "
Test mocks are covered in [Special Topics](test_mocks.qmd), because the example isn't from our app-package (it comes from the package development masterclass given at [posit::conf(2023)](https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/pkg-dev-masterclass)).

)
```

## Fixtures

```{r}
#| label: git_box_12b_tests-fixtures
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "12b_tests-fixtures", 
  repo = 'moviesApp')
```

<!-- https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/self-cleaning-test-fixtures/ -->

Test fixtures can be anything used to create repeatable test conditions (data, file paths, functions, etc.). Good test fixtures provide a consistent, well-defined test environment, and then are removed/destroyed when the test is executed. This ensures any changes made during the test don't persist or interfere with future tests.[^test_tools-5]

[^test_tools-5]: For a concrete example, see [this article](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/self-cleaning-test-fixtures/) on self-cleaning tests.

In R packages, test fixtures are stored in the `tests/testthat/fixtures/` folder:[^tests-fixtures-folder-name]

[^tests-fixtures-folder-name]: The name '`fixtures`' isn't required (you can name this folder anything).

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
tests/
├── testthat/
│   └── fixtures/                                         
└── testthat.R
```



### Test data

Large static data files are an example of a test fixture.[^test_tools-6] Any code used to create test data should be stored with the output file (using a clear naming convention).

[^test_tools-6]: Creating a tidied version of `ggplot2movies::movies` would be costly to re-create with every test, so it's advised to store it as an [static test fixture.](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html#sec-testing-advanced-concrete-fixture)

For example, I've stored the code used to create a ['tidy' version](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp/blob/12b_tests-fixtures/tests/testthat/fixtures/make-tidy_ggp2_movies.R) of the `ggplot2movies::movies` data along with the output dataset in `tests/testthat/fixtures/`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
tests
├── testthat
│   ├── fixtures
│   │   ├── make-tidy_ggp2_movies # <1>
│   │   └── tidy_ggp2_movies.rds # <2>
│   └── test-scatter_plot.R
└── testthat.R

3 directories, 4 files
```

1.  The code used to create the test data (`make-make_tidy_ggp2_movies.R`)
2.  The test data file (i.e., `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds`):

Data files stored in `tests/testthat/fixtures/` can be accessed with `testthat::test_path()` inside each test.

### Example: test fixture

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}

### BDD refresher: features & scenarios

In BDD, requirements are written plain language 'feature files' using a series of keywords:   

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
Feature: # <1>
  # <1>
  Background: # <2>
    Given # <3> 
    
  Scenario: # <4>
    When # <5>
    And # <6> 
    Then # <7>
    # <4>
```
1. **High-level description** (title and description)  
2. Steps or conditions that exist **before each scenario**   
3. Used to **describe the initial context** or **preconditions for the scenario**      
4. A series of steps outlining a **concrete examples that illustrates a feature**   
5. Used to **describe an event, or an action**  
6. Use to combine **`Given`**, **`When`**, or **`Then`**     
7. Use to **verify expected outcomes that are observable by a user**  

`Feature`, `Background`, and `Scenario` information can be included in nested `testthat::describe()` blocks, but every `Then` keyword should have a corresponding `testthat::it()` call.

Below is a test that answers the question, '*does the plot generate without producing an error?*' when using the `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds` test fixture with the `scatter_plot()` utility function. This type of test appropriate because we want to confirm the data source (`tidy_ggp2_movies`) will generate a plot object when passed to the `scatter_plot()` utility function, not necessarily the specific contents of the graph.[^test_tools-is.ggplot]

[^test_tools-is.ggplot]: Snapshot tests would be more appropriate for answering the question, ['*is the plot visually correct?*'](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/server-function-testing/index.html#complex-outputs-plots-htmlwidgets).

If the data `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds` in `tests/testthat/fixtures/` are going to be used repeatedly, it might also make sense to store it in `inst/extdata/` or `data-raw/`. Test fixtures are described in-depth in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html#test-fixtures) and in the [`testthat` documentation](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/test-fixtures.html#test-fixtures).

## Helpers

<!-- https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#testthat-helper-files -->

> "*Helper files are a mighty weapon in the battle to eliminate code floating around at the top-level of test files.*" Testthat helper files, [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#testthat-helper-files)

Test helpers reduce repeated/duplicated test code. In general, objects or values that aren't large enough to justify storing as static test fixtures can be created with helper functions. Helper functions are stored in `tests/testthat/helper.R`, which is automatically loaded with `devtools::load_all()`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
tests/
  ├── testthat/
  │   ├── fixtures/                                 # <1>
  │   │   ├── make-tidy_ggp2_movies.R               # <1>
  │   │   └── tidy_ggp2_movies.rds                  # <1>
  │   ├── helper.R                                  # <2>
  │   └── test-scatter_plot.R                       # <3>
  └── testthat.R
```

1.  Test fixture scripts and `.rds` files\
2.  Helper functions\
3.  Test file

Test helpers should only be created if they make testing easier **when the tests fail.** The article, ['Why Good Developers Write Bad Unit Tests'](https://mtlynch.io/good-developers-bad-tests/), provides great advice on complexity vs. clarity when writing unit tests,

> *'think about what will make the problem obvious when a test fails. Refactoring may reduce duplication, but it also increases complexity and potentially obscures information when things break.'*

R programmers resist copy + paste programming, and in most cases this makes sense. After all, R *is* a functional programming language, so it's tempting to bundle any repeated code into a function and store it in the `tests/testthat/helper.R` file.

However, when we're writing tests, it's more important that tests are easy to read and understand **when they fail**.

For example, consider the `ggp2_scatter_inputs` inputs passed to the `scatter_plot()` function in the previous test:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
ggp2_scatter_inputs <- list(  
        x = "rating",
        y = "length",
        z = "mpaa",
        alpha = 0.75,
        size = 3,
        plot_title = "Enter plot title"
)            
```

We could write a `var_inputs()` function that stores these values in a list. In our tests, this would allow us to use `var_inputs()` with the same 'reactive syntax' we use with `scatter_plot()` in the module server function:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: false 
#| collapse: true
var_inputs <- function() {
   list(x = "rating",
        y = "length",
        z = "mpaa",
        alpha = 0.75,
        size = 3,
        plot_title = "Enter plot title")
}
var_inputs()
```

While this removes duplicated code, it also makes it less clear for the reader what `var_inputs()` contains and where it was created (without opening the `helper.R` file).

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
#| collapse: true

tidy_ggp2_movies <- readRDS(test_path("fixtures", # <1>
                                "tidy_ggp2_movies.rds")) # <1>
  
app_graph <- scatter_plot(
  tidy_ggp2_movies,
  x_var = var_inputs()$x, # <2>
  y_var = var_inputs()$y,
  col_var = var_inputs()$z,
  alpha_var = var_inputs()$alpha,
  size_var = var_inputs()$size) # <2>

testthat::expect_true(ggplot2::is.ggplot(app_graph))
```
1. Load test fixture  
2. Identical to the code in `mod_scatter_display_server()`

In contrast, the `make_ggp2_inputs()` function below creates inputs for the `scatter_plot()` utility function:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
make_ggp2_inputs <- function() {
  glue::glue_collapse("list(x = 'rating',
     y = 'length',
     z = 'mpaa',
     alpha = 0.75,
     size = 3,
     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'
     )"
  )
}
```

I can call `make_ggp2_inputs()` in the **Console** and it will return the list of values to paste into each test:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
make_ggp2_inputs()
list(y = 'audience_score', 
     x = 'imdb_rating',
     z = 'mpaa_rating',
     alpha = 0.5,
     size = 2,
     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'
    )
```

This reduces the number of keystrokes per test, but doesn't obscure the source of the values in the test.

`glue::glue_collapse()` is your friend when you want to quickly reproduce code for your tests. `make_var_inputs()` creates the list of inputs for testing the original `movies` data:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: false 
make_var_inputs <- function() {
  glue::glue_collapse("list(y = 'audience_score', 
     x = 'imdb_rating',
     z = 'mpaa_rating',
     alpha = 0.5,
     size = 2,
     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'
    )")
}
```

```{r}
#| label: co_box_dry
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "r", 
  fold = FALSE,
  look = 'simple',
  size = "1.05", 
  hsize = "1.15",
  header = "Violating the DRY principle",
  contents = "
If you have repeated code in your tests, consider the following questions below before creating a helper function: 
  
1. Does the code help explain what behavior is being tested? 
  
2. Would a helper make it harder to debug the test when it fails?  
  
It’s more important that test code is obvious than DRY, because it’s more likely you’ll be dealing with this test when it fails (and you're not likely to remember why all the top-level code is there).
  
"
)
```

#### Logging

```{r}
#| label: git_box_12c_tests-helpers
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "12c_tests-helpers", 
  repo = 'moviesApp')
```

I prefer test outputs to be verbose, so I usually create a `test_logger()` helper function that allows me to give more context and information with each test:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: true
# test logger helper
test_logger <- function(start = NULL, end = NULL, msg) {
  if (is.null(start) & is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("{msg}")
  } else if (!is.null(start) & is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("\n[ START {start} = {msg}]")
  } else if (is.null(start) & !is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("\n[ END {end} = {msg}]")
  } else {
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("\n[ START {start} = {msg}]")
    cat("\n")
    logger::log_info("\n[ END {end} = {msg}]")
  }
}
```

`test_logger()` can be used to 'log' the `start` and `end` of each test, and it includes a message argument (`msg`) I'll use to reference the test `description` argument in each `it()` call.[^test_tools-logging]

[^test_tools-logging]: If you like verbose logging outputs, check out the [`logger` package](https://daroczig.github.io/logger/)

I tend to use functions like `test_logger()` enough to justify placing them in a testing utility file ([`R/testthat.R`](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp/blob/10c_tests-helpers/R/testthat.R)) below `R/`. Including testing functions in the `R/` folder also ensures they're documented (and any dependencies become part of your app-package).[^test_tools-helpers-r-dir]

[^test_tools-helpers-r-dir]: Placing common files for testing below `R/` is covered in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#hiding-in-plain-sight-files-below-r)

#### Test development 

While developing, using keyboard shortcuts makes it easier to iterate between building fixtures, writing and running tests, and checking code coverage.

```{r}
#| label: hot_key_tf_01
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
hot_key(fun = 'tf')
```

```{verbatim}

```

```{r}
#| label: hot_key_cf_01

#| eval: true
hot_key(fun = 'cf')
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
devtools:::test_coverage_active_file()
```

![Test coverage on active file](img/11_tests_coverage_scatter_plot.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}


#### Example: snapshots

```{r}
#| label: git_box_12g_tests-snapshots
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "12g_tests-snapshots", 
  repo = 'moviesApp')
```

Writing tests for graph outputs can be difficult because the "correctness" of a graph is somewhat subjective and requires human judgment. If the expected output we're interesting in testing is cumbersome to describe programmatically, we can consider using a snapshot tests. Examples of this include UI elements (which are mostly HTML created by Shiny's UI layout and input/output functions) and data visualizations.[^test_tools-snapshot-advice]

[^test_tools-snapshot-advice]: Mastering Shiny covers [creatng a snapshot file](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-testing.html#user-interface-functions) to test UI elements, but also notes this is probably not the best approach.

If we want to create a graph snapshot test, the [`vdiffr`](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/) package allows us to perform a 'visual unit test' by capturing the expected output as an `.svg` file that we can compare with future versions.

The `expect_doppelganger()` function from `vdiffr` is designed specifically to work with ['graphical plots'](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/reference/expect_doppelganger.html).

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
vdiffr::expect_doppelganger(
      title = "name of graph", 
      fig = # ...code to create graph...
  )
```

Another option for using snapshots for testing is the `expect_snapshot_file()` function [^test_tools-12] but `expect_doppelganger()` is probably the better option for comparing graph outputs.

[^test_tools-12]: Follow the `expect_snapshot_file()` example from the [`testthat` documentation](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_snapshot_file.html#ref-examples)

In this test, I'll list the `Feature` in a top-level `describe()` block, then nest the `Scenario` for the functional requirement in `it()` statements (with each snapshot the test will capture). Combining scenarios in the same test file is helpful if we're trying to keep a 1:1 between the `test/testthat/` file names and file names in `R/`.[^test_tools-13]

[^test_tools-13]: matching files names between `R/` and `tests/testthat/` keeps our code organized and ensures the `devtools::test_coverage_active_file()` function [works.](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/special-files.html)

We also see a warning when the snapshot has been saved in the `tests/testthat/_snaps/` folder the first time the test is run:

```{verbatim}

          Given I have launched the movie review exploration app,
          When the scatter plot renders,
          Then the points on the x axis should represent 'Ratings'
          And the points on the y axis should represent 'Length'
          And the points should be colored by 'MPAA' rating
          And the size of the points should be set to '2'

On subsequent runs, this warning will disappear (as long as there are no changes to the `.svg` files).

#### Advice on snapshots

Snapshots are brittle. The term "brittle" in the context of testing refers to a susceptibility to fail with small changes. Brittleness can produce false negatives test failures (i.e., due to inconsequential changes in the graph) when comparing a new graph to the baseline image.

Below is the output from `diffobj::diffObj()` comparing our custom plotting function (`scatter_plot()`) against a graph built with analogous `ggplot2` code:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
ggp_graph <- ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, 
              ggplot2::aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + 
              ggplot2::geom_point(
                ggplot2::aes(color = cyl), 
                             alpha = 0.5, 
                             size = 3)
  
app_graph <- scatter_plot(mtcars, 
                  x_var = "mpg", 
                  y_var = "disp", 
                  col_var = "cyl", 
                  alpha_var = 0.5, 
                  size_var = 3)

diffobj::diffObj(ggp_graph, app_graph)
```

Graph objects are difficult to use as test objects

The output shows us all the potential points of failure when comparing complex objects like graphs (despite the actual outputs appearing identical), so it's best to limit the number of 'visual unit tests' unless they're absolutely necessary.

**Shiny app-packages test suite**
  
- **Fixtures**: Fixtures prepare the test environment and the initial state. The `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds` data is a test fixture, and it creates the `tidy_ggp2_movies` data within the test scope. 

- **Helpers**: If find yourself writing small, reusable pieces of code to perform specific tasks inside your tests, consider converting them into a function in `tests/testthat/helper.R`.
