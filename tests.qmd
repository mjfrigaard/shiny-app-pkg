## Specifications

[Specifications](test_specs.qmd) discusses how to collect and organize user specifications, features, and functional requirements into a traceability matrix. 

## Test suite 

[Test suite](test_suite.qmd) starts by showing how to use `testthat` to create your app-package test infrastructure, then dives into creating test files, running tests during development, and introduces behavior-driven development.

## Test tools 

[This chapter](test_tools.qmd) introduces test fixtures, helpers, and mocks. Each tool can contribute to testing your shiny app-package in a unique way (they're also relatively recent additions to the `testthat` framework) 

## Testing modules 

Shiny's `testServer()` function can be useful for performing integration tests with module server functions. [Testing modules](test_modules.qmd) gives examples of using `testServer()` to verify module communication (i.e., passing data between modules). 

## System tests 

The [final chapter](test_system.qmd) in this section covers setting up and running system (or end-to-end tests with `shinytest2`).
